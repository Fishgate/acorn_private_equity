We&#8217;re trying our hardest to save your content somewhere even if your power goes out or your browser crashes. We even monitor your internet connection and prevent you from hitting that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button at the exact moment the coffee shop Wi-Fi has a hiccup.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the quick draft you lost last week is still in the database, and just hidden from view. As an added complication, these &#8220;discarded drafts&#8221; normally get deleted after seven days, and it&#8217;s already been six days since the release. If we were able to rescue your draft, you&#8217;ll see it on the &#8220;All Posts&#8221; screen after you update to 3.8.3. (We&#8217;ll also be pushing 3.8.3 out as a background update, so you may just see a draft appear.)</p>\n<p>So, if you tried to jot down a quick idea last week, I hope WordPress has recovered it for you.

Touesnard introduced Query Recorder earlier this month at WordCamp Miami during his presentation on database deployment strategy.</p>\n<p>Once installed, the plugin allows you to create recordings that save queries run by your theme or plugins.

You can record queries as you&#8217;re setting up a theme or plugin and create a SQL script that can be run later when deploying to another site. You can quickly test plugins and themes and then import the sql file when setting them up on a staging or live site. This is much easier than having to repeat those exact steps again in another environment.</p>\n<p>I tested the plugin and it works exactly as advertised.

In fact, the page hasn&#8217;t changed much since 2.7.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23752" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WordPress27PluginsPage.png" rel="prettyphoto[23671]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23752" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/WordPress27PluginsPage.png?resize=831%2C537" alt="WordPress 2.7 Plugins Page" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress 2.7 Plugins Page</p></div>\n<p>However, that may change as Alex Shiels has proposed a <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/">detailed outline</a> explaining the improvements and changes he&#8217;d like to see. According to Shiels, the goal is to improve the experience for both new and experienced users.</p>\n<p>One of the suggested improvements is to have the plugin-install.php be the default page when selecting the Plugins menu in the backend of WordPress. I generally use the plugins page to activate or deactivate plugins for troubleshooting purposes. By making plugin-install.php the default page, it would require an extra step to browse to the installed plugins page.</p>\n<p>Instead, I&#8217;d rather the default page be left alone and enable the search box to find plugins within the directory. Other users <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/#comment-15346" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/#comment-15346">have chimed in</a> with similar feedback. As Shiels mentioned, &#8220;the Search Installed Plugins box on plugins.php is easily mistaken for a plugin directory search.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="attachment_23753" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PluginSearchBox.png" rel="prettyphoto[23671]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23753" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/PluginSearchBox.png?resize=807%2C455" alt="Users Mistakenly Use The Search Box To Search The Plugin Directory" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Users Mistakenly Use The Search Box To Search The Plugin Directory</p></div>\n<p>I want the search engine for plugins to be improved. I&#8217;d also like to be able to organize search results by ratings, reviews, download count, etc. I&#8217;m happy to see the tag cloud may potentially be removed in favor of specific categories.</p>\n<p>Something I&#8217;d love to see is the ability to rate and review plugins from the backend of WordPress. This way, I wouldn&#8217;t have to visit each plugin&#8217;s page on the directory to give feedback. I&#8217;d also like to be able to access that information somehow on the Installed Plugins page.</p>\n<p>I think the Visit Plugin Site URL should link to the WordPress.org page listing for the plugin, not the author&#8217;s website. It would make it a lot easier to find the appropriate location to get support or view other data about the plugin on WordPress.org.</p>\n<h3>User Submitted Ideas</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of great ideas in the comments of the post. For instance, <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/#comment-15350" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/#comment-15350">Brad Tousnard suggested</a> a Plugin installation that uses AJAX to install plugins in-place instead of having to go through a series of steps or have separate browser tabs open to install multiple plugins.</p>\n<p>The plugin page doesn&#8217;t show whether or a not a plugin is dependent on another to work properly. Although there is a <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11308" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11308">four-year old trac ticket</a> that has a lengthy discussion about the topic, nothing concrete has been established. Once it&#8217;s out, the next step would be to create an easy way to see those dependencies when searching for plugins.</p>\n<h3>How to Get Involved</h3>\n<p>Since nearly everyone has experience managing plugins in WordPress, it&#8217;s no wonder the post is generating so much feedback. If you want to get involved with helping Shiels make improvements to the page, keep an eye on the <a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/component/Plugins" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/component/Plugins">Plugins Component</a> on Trac. This is where tickets specifically for that part of WordPress will be located. You can also <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/28/improving-the-plugins-page/">leave feedback on the post</a> with suggestions you have.</p>\n<p>What changes would you like to see that would improve searching, adding, and managing plugins in WordPress for new and advanced users?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 May 2014 21:32:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"WPTavern: WP-CFM: A Free Plugin for Storing and Deploying WordPress Database Configurations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23708";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:224:"http://wptavern.com/wp-cfm-a-free-plugin-for-storing-and-deploying-wordpress-database-configurations?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-cfm-a-free-plugin-for-storing-and-deploying-wordpress-database-configurations";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4903:"<p><a href="http://forumone.github.io/wp-cfm/" target="_blank">WP-CFM</a> is a new free tool for WordPress created by <a href="https://twitter.com/mgibbs189" target="_blank">Matt Gibbs</a>, author of the popular <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-field-suite/" target="_blank">Custom Field Suite</a> plugin. It provides configuration management for WordPress database changes, similar to Drupal&#8217;s <a href="https://drupal.org/project/features" target="_blank">Features</a> module.</p>\n<p>WP-CFM lets you create and store bundles, which are essentially a group of one or more configuration options. The first step after installing the plugin is to create a /wp-content/config/ directory and grant write access.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/add-bundle.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23708]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/add-bundle.jpg?resize=967%2C339" alt="add-bundle" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23730" /></a></p>\n<p>WP-CFM provides a friendly interface for viewing the contents of the wp_options table so that you can select the options you want to be stored in a specific bundle. For example, let&#8217;s say that you want to grab all of your Jetpack options for deploying somewhere else. Create a Jetpack bundle:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/jetpack-bundle.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23708]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/jetpack-bundle.jpg?resize=892%2C530" alt="jetpack-bundle" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23733" /></a></p>\n<p>Each bundle has options for diff, push and pull:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>diff</strong> &#8211; comparison of database version vs the file version</li>\n<li><strong>push</strong> &#8211; write database changes to the file system</li>\n<li><strong>pull</strong> &#8211; import file changes in the database</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Selecting &#8216;push&#8217; will store the database configuration in the file system (wp-content/config) as a .json file that you can then pull into your database at a later time or pull into another server.</p>\n<p>One very common example where WP-CFM would be helpful is in the case of widgets options. Step one is to create a widgets bundle:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/widget-options.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23708]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/widget-options.jpg?resize=818%2C380" alt="widget-options" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23737" /></a></p>\n<p>Next you would create a widgets diff:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/widgets-diff.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23708]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/widgets-diff.jpg?resize=966%2C390" alt="widgets-diff" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23738" /></a></p>\n<p>From here you can push those changes to the filesystem so they&#8217;re ready to deploy at another time. Most of the time when using WP-CFM, you&#8217;ll follow this basic workflow for storing and deploying configurations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make database changes</li>\n<li>Store them in configuration management</li>\n<li>Push the file to another server</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The &#8216;push&#8217; option on the All Bundles item writes all of your bundles to the file system at once, which is fairly handy. WP-CFM also includes developer hooks for registering custom configuration items, including a callback parameter for configuration data that is not stored within wp_options.</p>\n<p>Deploying bundles is really easy with WP-CFM&#8217;s support for WP-CLI, which enables you to pull or push bundles from the command line. Setting the bundle_name to &#8220;all&#8221; will push/pull all at once:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">wp config pull &lt;bundle_name&gt;\nwp config push &lt;bundle_name&gt;</pre>\n<h3>Benefits of using WP-CFM</h3>\n<p>WP-CFM can save you quite a bit of time when working alone but it really shines when working with team of multiple developers. In the docs, Gibbs identifies the benefits of including it in your workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less need to copy the database. If you make changes, Push your bundle to the filesystem. To load changes, Pull the bundle into your database.</li>\n<li>No need to manually apply database settings changes. No more &#8220;fire drills&#8221; where you&#8217;re rushing to figure out which settings you forgot to change.</li>\n<li>Track and migrate configuration files using git, subversion, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WP-CFM is an excellent new tool for simplifying deployments and the best part is that it&#8217;s totally free. You can download it from <a href="https://github.com/forumone/wp-cfm" target="_blank">Github</a> or via the plugin&#8217;s <a href="http://forumone.github.io/wp-cfm/" target="_blank">homepage</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 29 May 2014 19:05:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"WPTavern: TeslaThemes Celebrates One Year Of Being In Business";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23669";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:168:"http://wptavern.com/teslathemes-celebrates-one-year-of-being-in-business?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=teslathemes-celebrates-one-year-of-being-in-business";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3966:"<p>When I <a title="http://wptavern.com/interview-with-brand-new-theme-club-teslathemes" href="http://wptavern.com/interview-with-brand-new-theme-club-teslathemes">discovered TeslaThemes last year</a>, their unique looking designs really impressed me. Since so many other theme shops have tried the theme club model and failed, I didn&#8217;t have much hope for them. However, the company is celebrating <a title="http://teslathemes.com/blog/celebrating-our-1st-year-anniversary-with-fantastic-offers/" href="http://teslathemes.com/blog/celebrating-our-1st-year-anniversary-with-fantastic-offers/">their first year</a> of being in business.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TeslaThemesFeaturedImage.png" rel="prettyphoto[23669]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23716" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TeslaThemesFeaturedImage.png?resize=650%2C200" alt="TeslaThemes Birthday Featured Image" /></a>The theme club model typically fails because it over promises and under delivers. The model is especially difficult for small 1-3 person businesses. While time is devoted to churning out new products, there also needs to be support in place for previously released items.</p>\n<p>TeslaThemes co-founder, March Sobeiski, told me they have released two new themes per month since launching the business while maintaining a customer satisfaction rating of 98% based on their monthly surveys. Sobeiski says one of the greatest challenges the company faced is their rapid growth. &#8220;The greatest challenge TeslaThemes overcame in the first year is the fact that we are one of the fastest growing and healthy Premium WP Theme Clubs with a very strong community and stable workflow.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The company is part of the <a title="http://www.red-sky.com/" href="http://www.red-sky.com/">Red Sky group</a>, a Polish investment firm. &#8220;The financial perspective wasn&#8217;t the most important concern. This gave us the opportunity to focus purely on quality and roll out. At the moment, we are financially independent and have great plans ahead&#8221; Sobeiski said. This is a luxury not many theme shops get to take advantage of.</p>\n<p>When asked what pivotal lessons were learned during the first year of business, Sobeiski replied:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Quality. This is the essence of this business. There are thousands of WP themes on the market, many of them are free, many are ripped, many are stolen, but what a simple user or advanced design studio needs is actual quality. Before going live, every developer or designer must be sure they provide what the market needs plus something special, and not just duplicate existing and successful WP themes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>With some WordPress commercial theme business owners discussing whether <a title="http://chriswallace.net/wordpress-themes-become-commodity/" href="http://chriswallace.net/wordpress-themes-become-commodity/">WordPress themes have become a commodity,</a> there is also the advice of concentrating on a specific niche. TeslaThemes plans on creating more themes to expand their catalog to cover more niches. If Chris Lema is right about <a title="http://chrislema.com/more-future-of-wordpress-themes/" href="http://chrislema.com/more-future-of-wordpress-themes/">theme purchasing patterns</a>, it will end up being a good strategy.</p>\n<p>For year number two, Sobeiski says they&#8217;ll focus on co-operation with their customers while creating a 24/7 dedicated support channel. They&#8217;re also working on a new project called TeslaLab. TeslaLab is a dedicated paid customization center where customers can receive professional help with customizing their theme.</p>\n<p>So far, the company has proven that the club model can work but is it a sustainable model for long-term success? Only time will tell.</p>\n<p>Have you done business with TeslaThemes?

Ryan McCue and his team released <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-json-rest-api-version-1-0-released" target="_blank">version 1.0</a> over the weekend and have been pushing hard for it to be ready for the upcoming 4.0 release.</p>\n<p>When I spoke with McCue yesterday about the API&#8217;s readiness for 4.0, he said, &#8220;At this point, the API is considered feature complete. The upcoming 1.1 release is going to be heavily focused on testing and documentation, plus some general bug fixing as per usual. Moving forward, we&#8217;ll basically just be building out new features as needed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The discussion today resulted in an agreement to put the WP API project on the 4.1 roadmap, as it still hasn&#8217;t received the requisite testing and real-world exposure that core contributors would like to see before giving it the green light.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s &#8216;ready&#8217; for use, which is exciting,&#8221; Nacin said, when weighing in on the API during the meeting. <strong>&#8220;Now we just have to get it ready for the next five years and 22% of the internet.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Nacin suggested putting it squarely on the 4.1 roadmap with hopes of attracting more core contributors for the final mile. Although everyone is excited about having this new API in core, it&#8217;s an addition that all agreed is worthy of stronger core feedback before pushing it forward.</p>\n<h3>The WP API in the Wild</h3>\n<p>Meanwhile, more real-world examples of the API in use are popping up. <a href="https://twitter.com/ericandrewlewis" target="_blank">Eric Andrew Lewis</a>, a web developer for the New York Times, remarked, &#8220;We&#8217;re implementing it as of yesterday because it&#8217;s stable now.&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/kadamwhite" target="_blank">K. Adam White</a> also <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/25/json-rest-api-version-1-0/#comment-15415" target="_blank">commented</a> on the most recent make.wordpress.org update to report that his team is already making use of the API at <a href="http://bocoup.com/" target="_blank">Bocoup</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re using the API as the content backend for an in-development Node.js website and several single-page applications; nothing I can share publicly yet, but the API project was the tipping point that let me convince my colleagues that WordPress was a suitable backend for a non-PHP application. We’re really excited about the work we’re doing and I look forward to sharing it later in the year.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although McCue feels that the API is ready for WordPress 4.0, those present at the development meeting agreed that more eyes and testers will help to ensure that the API enters core in a more robust state.</p>\n<h3>How WordPress Plugin and Theme Developers Can Help Test the WP API</h3>\n<div id="attachment_23698" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/building.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23676]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/building.jpg?resize=1024%2C526" alt="photo credit: shenamt - cc" class="size-full wp-image-23698" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shenamt/6906784503/">shenamt</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>WordPress developers are already doing some exciting things, such as creating plugins based on the API, i.e. the <a href="https://github.com/modemlooper/buddypress-json-api" target="_blank">BuddyPress JSON API</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-json-api" target="_blank">Pods JSON API</a> that emerged shortly after 1.0 was released. McCue believes that finding your own special interest is a good way to join in testing the API:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Contributing to a large project like WordPress core or the API isn&#8217;t always the easiest thing to do; these projects have certain rules and standards that can be annoying to have to deal with. The API is very much structured as the base for developers to build off, and it&#8217;s always much easier building with something you know, so I think finding something you&#8217;re familiar with and trying to integrate that with the API is a great way to both learn it, and help us test it out.</p></blockquote>\n<p>McCue is also keen to get WordPress theme developers testing the API with their projects, using the project&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/client-js" target="_blank">Javascript library</a>. <strong>&#8220;We&#8217;ve tried to design this so that even frontend developers with minimal knowledge of WordPress can go out and start creating, and those with WP knowledge can feel at home,&#8221;</strong> he said.</p>\n<p>During the development meeting McCue was asked about the advantages of theming with the API vs. calling the database through conventional (PHP) means. &#8220;You can do nice stuff like loading new content without a full page load,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And because of WP API’s internal reusability, you can also render it server side with practically the same code.&#8221; Others chimed in that lazy loading, AJAX calls, infinite scroll and the like will be much easier to implement with the new API.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The biggest effect I think the REST API will have is in opening up this data to other developers, including plugin and theme developers,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;We&#8217;re increasingly seeing more advanced front ends, including <a href="https://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress-themes/collections/" target="_blank">Theme Foundry&#8217;s Collections</a> theme, P2 and the upcoming o2, and sites like <a href="http://qz.com/" target="_blank">Quartz</a>, and WP API will enable these sorts of sites to be built much quicker.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the past, these sorts of projects were extraordinarily unique endeavors that required a great deal of effort to build. With the JSON REST API finally added to WordPress core, the platform will be more open to unique use cases.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The API will enable front end developers to build themes on WordPress without needing to know PHP or many of WP&#8217;s quirks,&#8221; McCue said. <strong>&#8220;I believe it will really open up WordPress as a framework that&#8217;s easily accessible to everyone.&#8221;</strong> As the project stands today, the team is working towards making improvements that will ensure the API&#8217;s readiness for WordPress 4.1. If you have feedback to add from working with version 1.0 or would like to contribute to the project, join the WP API Team Tuesdays in the #wordpress-dev channel on IRC at 00:00 UTC.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 May 2014 23:14:14 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:87:"WPTavern: WordPress.com Security Vulnerability Stirs Debate Over Responsible Disclosure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23537";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:218:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-security-vulnerability-stirs-debate-over-responsible-disclosure?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-com-security-vulnerability-stirs-debate-over-responsible-disclosure";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6809:"<p>Late last week, Yan Zhu, a Staff Technologist for the <a title="https://eff.org/" href="https://eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation </a>publicly <a title="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/" href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/">disclosed</a> a security vulnerability she discovered with WordPress.com and how it handles cookies.

The main reason is that SSL support nowadays is widely accepted as the bare *minimum* security guarantee that a website should provide for users’ private information, and this is essentially a bug in WordPress’s SSL support. “Only send auth info over SSL” has been the most basic security recommendation to website operators for the last 15+ years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although <a title="http://automattic.com/security/" href="http://automattic.com/security/">Automattic states</a> they&#8217;ll try to contact the reporter within 24 hours, I&#8217;d give them at least 72. The WordPress core handbook states that <strong>in all cases, you should not publish the details</strong>. The Automattic submission form states, &#8220;If you happen to find a <strong>security vulnerability</strong> in one of our services, we would appreciate letting us know before disclosing the issue publicly.&#8221; Perhaps the Automattic submission form should also request that reporters not publish the details.</p>\n<h3>When Disclosure Becomes Irresponsible</h3>\n<p>Any time a security vulnerability is disclosed before it&#8217;s fixed within a reasonable time frame, it&#8217;s irresponsible disclosure. Of course, what is a reasonable time frame is subjective but common sense dictates at least 3-5 days to hear a response back. Besides, they have to verify and duplicate the report in order to come up with a fix. Even if the issue is already known to attackers or is easy to find, it doesn&#8217;t make it <strong>ok</strong> to publicize it through the media. These types of actions fan the flames and make the reporter look like the bad person.</p>\n<p>When it comes to how long of a time frame is acceptable before going to the public, everyone likely has a different answer. It also depends on what has gone on behind the scenes. For instance, when was it reported and when did the company respond back? Did they promise a fix but haven&#8217;t released it in months? In rare instances, publicizing a vulnerability is the only way to get a company to act but should be treated as the nuclear option.</p>\n<p>In the comments of Zhu&#8217;s article, <a title="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/#comment-106" href="https://zyan.scripts.mit.edu/blog/wordpress-fail/#comment-106">Matt Mullenweg thanked her</a> for the report with a request that she allow more time for Automattic to act.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thank you very much for finding and investigating this problem. If there’s a next time, I would definitely appreciate it if you gave us a few days more next time to protect users before it’s public.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Do you think Zhu is in the wrong for publishing details of the security issue too soon or was 24 hours enough time for Automattic to implement a fix? If you discovered a security vulnerability and reported it to the vendor, what would need to happen to convince you that publicizing is the only way to get it fixed?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 May 2014 19:46:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"Matt: New Socket.IO 1.0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=43826";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-socket-io-1-0/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:225:"<p><a href="http://socket.io/blog/introducing-socket-io-1-0/#credits">Socket.IO 1.0 is available</a> with a number of new features, including binary support.

It ran earlier this month with four days (Thursday &#8211; Sunday) packed full of activities. Multiple venues, parking areas, presentation tracks, catering and food vendors can all add to the likelihood of unexpected delays or changes in schedule.</p>\n<p>How do you keep that many people informed with updates? Text alerts were the glue that kept everyone together on the same page, according to organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/" target="_blank">David Bisset</a>. WordCamp Miami utilized <a href="https://gather.mailchimpapp.com/" target="_blank">MailChimp&#8217;s Gather service</a> to shoot out reminders and changes of schedule.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gather-text-update.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[22934]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/gather-text-update.jpg?resize=296%2C516" alt="gather-text-update" class="alignright size-full wp-image-23647" /></a>Many WordCamps use MailChimp to organize event emails. The Gather app allows you to text message your MailChimp email subscribers to keep them updated throughout the event. Subscribers can respond to organizers individually with no app or setup required. For example, if you want to alert everyone where parking is located, you can send a quick text in the morning. Attendees can also alert you to any problems.</p>\n<p>When you set up a new event with Gather, it gives you a customizable signup form that you can share via Twitter, email or your MailChimp account. It also gives you a phone number to use that is separate from your personal number, so you can retain your privacy. The organizer never has access to subscribers&#8217; phone numbers and the service automatically deletes the numbers after the event expires.</p>\n<p>Pricing is a nominal fee that you pre-pay for bundles of text messages, depending on the size of your event: 175 messages for $8.99, 500 messages for $18.99, or 2000 messages for $48.99. This includes your new Gather phone number.</p>\n<h3>Getting Attendees to Sign Up For Text Alerts</h3>\n<p>Getting people to sign up for text alerts may not be the easiest task, as nobody wants to open up their phone to a flood of unimportant messages or info that&#8217;s already printed in the schedule.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a good idea to assure your subscribers that you&#8217;re not going to overload them with texts. Make sure they know their numbers will be deleted after the event and that you&#8217;ll send only the important stuff. WordCamp Miami did a good job of this on its text alerts signup page:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will keep the notifications to a minimum. They will involve any last-minute session/room changes, after party information, and emergency information.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bisset had three separate text message channels for the event, including one for general attendees, volunteer corps, and WordCamp organizers. He said that it kept their team from having to run around and holler at each other for help during the event.</p>\n<p>As an attendee and speaker at WordCamp Miami, I can attest to the fact that these text message alerts kept everything running like a well-oiled machine. I would highly recommend them to any organizer who is looking to improve the overall event experience for attendees and volunteers.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 May 2014 19:08:24

Reading through that <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changelog/0.70" target="_blank">changelog</a> will make you smile and realize how far the software has come since the early days when its main competitors were <a href="http://www.textpattern.com/" target="_blank">Textpattern</a> and <a href="http://movabletype.org/" target="_blank">Movable Type</a>.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 11 years and WordPress now powers <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">22% of the web</a> with a content management system market share of 60.0%. Many moons ago, when you were hacking <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/default" target="_blank">Kubrick</a>, did you ever imagine that you&#8217;d see WordPress <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-featured-in-apples-new-ipad-advertising-campaign" target="_blank">featured in an Apple product advertisement</a>? Could you have predicted that WordPress would power major news publications and government sites around the globe?</p>\n<p>Over the past decade, this open source platform has enabled people to build creative, thriving businesses that support their families and improve the lives of others in small and big ways. With more than 31,000 free <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/" target="_blank">plugins</a> and 665 million plugin downloads, WordPress&#8217; extensibility makes it possible for the platform to power nearly any kind of website, from major corporations to universities to social networks. Best of all, WordPress has helped ordinary people tell their stories and find a voice in the world.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s to the people who build WordPress, the ever-growing community that supports it, and the users who choose to publish with it every day. Happy birthday and congratulations on 11 years burning brighter.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 28 May 2014 05:00:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"WPTavern: WordPress for iOS Featured in Apple’s New iPad Advertising Campaign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23507";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:196:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-ios-featured-in-apples-new-ipad-advertising-campaign?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-for-ios-featured-in-apples-new-ipad-advertising-campaign";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2437:"<p>Apple has a new advertisement for iPad, featuring Chérie King, whose WordPress-powered <a href="http://flightofthetravelbee.com/" target="_blank">Flight of the Travel Bee</a> blog is dedicated to helping deaf people discover the joy of traveling.</p>\n<p>Her story can be found at <a href="http://www.apple.com/cherie" target="_blank">apple.com/cherie</a> and is included as part of the &#8220;<a href="http://www.apple.com/your-verse/" target="_blank">What will your verse be?</a>&#8221; campaign.

The survey was conducted between March 7 – April 11, 2014. 183 people from 37 countries participated.

Out of those who have contributed to the project, only 7% have written articles for the Codex.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23562" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ContributedTobbPress.png" rel="prettyphoto[23441]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23562" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ContributedTobbPress.png?resize=592%2C823" alt="bbPress Codex Articles Are Hard To Come By" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">bbPress Codex Articles Are Hard To Come By</p></div>\n<p>It probably doesn&#8217;t help that in order to log into the bbPress.org website, you need to log into BuddyPress.org first. Then after you login, you&#8217;re not redirected to bbPress.org, you&#8217;re stuck on BuddyPress.org. If newcomers are looking to contribute to the Codex, you won&#8217;t be able to learn how because the <a title="http://codex.bbpress.org/participate-and-contribute/codex-standards-guidelines/" href="http://codex.bbpress.org/participate-and-contribute/codex-standards-guidelines/">Codex Standards and Guidelines</a> document links to a 404 error page.</p>\n<p>When asked what are the strengths of bbPress, the top four answers are what I&#8217;d expect.

In fact, it&#8217;s the same set of complaints I&#8217;ve read and heard over the past few years. It lacks features out of the box compared to other forum software which leads to using several plugins just to bring it up to par. What surprises me most is that 54% said they were not sure about the future of the plugin.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23566" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bbPressUncertainFuture.png" rel="prettyphoto[23441]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23566" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bbPressUncertainFuture.png?resize=581%2C375" alt="Uncertain Of The Future Of bbPress" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Uncertain Of The Future Of bbPress</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s been <a title="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2463" href="https://bbpress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2463">four years</a> since bbPress switched from being a stand alone piece of software to a WordPress plugin. There was <a title="http://bbpress.org/forums/topic/bbpress-plugin-is-born/" href="http://bbpress.org/forums/topic/bbpress-plugin-is-born/">a lot of uncertainty</a> about the project around the time of the switch but that was four years ago. I&#8217;m curious as to why 54% of respondents are not sure about the future of the plugin. In those four years, John James Jacoby, Stephen Edgar, and several other contributors have made substantial improvements to the plugin. How could those improvements lead to uncertainty?</p>\n<p>The requested improvements and new features list are similar to the list of most popular bbPress plugins activated. While attachments took the top spot with 42%, most of the votes were evenly distributed. This leads me to believe users would like to see every feature in the list added to bbPress. Take a look at the list of features and tell me which are not already available in most forum software.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23567" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TopRequestedItems.png" rel="prettyphoto[23441]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23567" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/TopRequestedItems.png?resize=482%2C621" alt="Top Requested bbPress Features" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Top Requested bbPress Features</p></div>\n<p>88% of respondents said they evaluated other forum software before deciding on bbPress. Of those evaluated, phpBB took the top spot with 72%. The SimplePress plugin took second place with 44%. Despite its lack of features out of the box, bbPress was chosen by many of the respondents over other popular forum software. Considering the price tag on vBulletin, I was surprised it ranked so high.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23568" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OtherForumSoftwareEvaluated.png" rel="prettyphoto[23441]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23568" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/OtherForumSoftwareEvaluated.png?resize=579%2C369" alt="Other Forum Software Evaluated" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Other Forum Software Evaluated</p></div>\n<h3>bbPress Has Come A Long Way But Has So Much Further To Go</h3>\n<p>In 2009, I <a title="http://wptavern.com/why-i-use-vbulletin" href="http://wptavern.com/why-i-use-vbulletin">explained why</a> I chose vBulletin over bbPress to power the WP Tavern forum. Many of the reasons in that post are still valid arguments for why I&#8217;d probably not use bbPress today. It makes me sad to see so many huge walls in front of the bbPress project. As an end-user, the lack of features in bbPress is a detriment, not a feature itself. The code that makes up bbPress is some of the best you&#8217;ll see in a WordPress plugin but great code doesn&#8217;t equate to mainstream use.</p>\n<p>bbPress has a lot going for it. It&#8217;s a WordPress plugin so it works with WordPress as if they are one entity and being a plugin, it&#8217;s simple to install. The default theme compatibility enables it to blend in with just about every WordPress theme. It&#8217;s free, open source, and considered an official plugin and there&#8217;s a passionate community supporting it.</p>\n<p>If bbPress is ever going to be on par with other forum solutions, it&#8217;s going to have to pack more punch into its default feature set. I&#8217;m not the only who thinks so. Take this survey comment for example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Needs a lot more focus on adding front end features both for users and mods/admins. There is a serious lack of traditional forum features that people expect to have, and it really holds bbPress back.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I think users would love to have something that suits most of their needs out of the box and then add plugins for additional functionality. Unfortunately, bbPress requires several plugins to be installed before it can even be considered on par with its competition.</p>\n<h3>Will bbPress Ever Be Mainstream?</h3>\n<p>There are other forces at work besides what is going on internally with bbPress. The nature of social interaction on the web is radically different from 10 years ago. Forums were like watering holes for specific topics with like-minded individuals. Today, most of the conversation happens on one or more social networks. There is also an <a title="http://www.businessesgrow.com/2014/03/26/eliminating-comments/" href="http://www.businessesgrow.com/2014/03/26/eliminating-comments/">ongoing trend</a> of large websites turning comments off.</p>\n<p>One of the <a title="http://bbpress.org/blog/2013/11/bbpress-2-5-released/" href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2013/11/bbpress-2-5-released/">signature features of bbPress 2.6</a> will replace WordPress comments with bbPress topics. You&#8217;ll be able to replace your comment form with bbPress and merge together community conversations that forums provide with directed topics of conversation via the blog. It&#8217;s a marriage of functionality I&#8217;ve been wanting for years but it might be too little too late.</p>\n<p>Will this feature spark a renaissance of forums, community, and on site conversations or has managing such things become too much work? Will we ever see the day when the percentage of sites using bbPress is as closely monitored as that of sites using WordPress?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 27 May 2014 23:00:37 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:54:"WPTavern: WordPress JSON REST API Version 1.0 Released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23496";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:152:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-json-rest-api-version-1-0-released?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-json-rest-api-version-1-0-released";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4946:"<p>Version 1.0 of the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/" target="_blank">JSON REST API plugin</a> was <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/2014/05/25/json-rest-api-version-1-0/" target="_blank">released</a> over the weekend, adding new user, revision and post meta endpoints. This release also introduces the project&#8217;s new long-term backwards compatibility policy for its internal PHP API and REST API, which will not be broken from this point forward as new endpoints and data are added.</p>\n<p>The WP API project is led by <a href="https://twitter.com/rmccue" target="_blank">Ryan McCue</a>, who said that the team is pushing hard for integration into WordPress 4.0, although it is not yet guaranteed. McCue published an <a href="https://gist.github.com/rmccue/722769379f4fc4148b1f" target="_blank">integration plan</a> for getting the WP API into core for the 4.0 merge window, if the project receives the green light.</p>\n<h4>Understanding the Benefits of the JSON REST API</h4>\n<p>McCue&#8217;s proposal highlights the need for an alternative to the XML-RPC API that is currently provided in core and demonstrates how the JSON REST API provides a superior solution for allowing remote access to data.</p>\n<p>Because the WP API was designed from the ground up for integration into WordPress, it follows WP coding standards and will enter the core with full translatability. The WP API is being built to eventually include every data type found in WordPress, including post types and their metadata. It&#8217;s also built with extensibility in mind for themes and plugins and makes liberal use of actions and filters.</p>\n<p>In addition to the huge benefit of the API being built <strong>FOR</strong> WordPress, McCue sites several other distinct benefits to its inclusion in core, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data serialization uses the JSON standard, which maps more directly to common data structures in most programming languages.</li>\n<li>Communication with the API uses the HTTP 1.1 standard, available in almost every programming language. Representational State Transfer (&#8220;REST&#8221;) semantics are used for interaction, which are available in the majority of HTTP clients, and compatibility is provided for those without this ability.</li>\n<li>The data serialization layer is independent of the data manipulation and accessing layer, enabling the JSON or HTTP semantics to be replaced with another protocol, (i.e. MessagePack or Cap&#8217;n Proto.)</li>\n<li>The internal structure of the API allows use by regular PHP code. This enables using the data layer of the API for other uses, such as a future version of WP-CLI or internal form handlers.</li>\n</li>\n<li>The API relies on no external services. It includes methods for automatically locating the API given only a WordPress site address, as well as programatically assessing the availability of parts of the API.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>WordPress Developers are Already Building API Plugins</h4>\n<p>This API constitutes a monolithic addition to the WordPress codebase but it opens up a whole new world for developers who are extending the platform to access information remotely. Shortly after version 1.0 was released, a few WordPress developers reported back about making use of the API in their projects.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bp-json-api.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23496]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/bp-json-api.jpg?resize=226%2C219" alt="bp-json-api" class="alignright size-full wp-image-23526" /></a>Ryan Fugate (@modemlooper), took the initiative to add <a href="https://github.com/modemlooper/buddypress-json-api" target="_blank">BuddyPress JSON API</a> endpoints. When Scott Kingsley Clark saw the starter scaffolding for the BuddyPress API, he was inspired to build a <a href="https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-json-api" target="_blank">Pods JSON API</a> for his <a href="http://pods.io/" target="_blank">Pods Framework</a> in just a few short hours.</p>\n<p>McCue and his team of contributors are now starting on a documentation and testing push to prepare the plugin for possible inclusion into WordPress 4.0. A documentation site is now up at <a href="http://wp-api.github.io/" target="_blank">wp-api.github.io</a>. These docs are very much in transition as the project moves forward and will eventually include the <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tree/master/docs/guides" target="_blank">guides</a> and master <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/tree/master/docs" target="_blank">docs</a> which are in different places right now.

Make is a free, drag and drop theme that makes it easy to manipulate the design of pages. In the interview, Strojny explains why Make is available for free and why the page building aspect of the theme was not put into its own plugin.

By activating Hide Plugins, you will be able to see all plugins and a toggle to hide each plugin from other users on the Plugins page. Hide Plugins will always remain hidden.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-color-on-word-count/" title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-color-on-word-count/">Editor Color</a> on Word Count automatically changes the color of the content editor based on the number of words written. For example, if you have written 90 words, the editor color would be light red and when you cross the 100 words limit, it changes to yellow. After 300 words, it automatically changes to green to indicate you&#8217;ve reached your goal.</p>\n<h2>WPWeekly Meta:</h2>\n<p><strong>Next Episode:</strong> Friday, May 30th 3 P.M.

One of the ideas being pursued are lesson modules. The modules explain all the aspects of developing, editing, and learning about themes.</p>\n<p>Despite a lot of excitement and interest at the beginning of the project, most of the work has been completed by Tracy Levesque and Courtney O&#8217;Callaghan. Shortly after contributor day, the two were given <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/training/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/">their own site</a> as a sub-group of the WordPress Community group.</p>\n<p>The proposed <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/training/theme-curriculum/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/theme-curriculum/">curriculum</a> covers everything from explaining what a theme is, to creating and altering child themes. The basic layout of each module contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a short intro in what you will learn (written or video)</li>\n<li>voice over screencast walk through (user could follow along if they wanted to)</li>\n<li>2-3 practice examples</li>\n<li>self quiz for each topic</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Results Of Using The Module For The First Time</h3>\n<p>The <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/training/modules-in-progress/child-theme-module/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/modules-in-progress/child-theme-module/">Child Theme module</a> is the first to be nearly completed. The module is structured in such a way that it&#8217;s like a lesson planner for school. I used it to teach 20 members of our local WordPress meetup why it&#8217;s important to use child themes. I read the module text and performed the exercises while everyone in the room watched the projector. It wasn&#8217;t until we reached the point where attendees could see the child theme manipulating the parent theme, when they finally understood the concept.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23450" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ChildModuleDiagram.png" rel="prettyphoto[23344]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23450" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ChildModuleDiagram.png?resize=686%2C246" alt="Diagram Showing The Loading Sequence Of WP Themes" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Diagram Showing The Loading Sequence Of WP Themes</p></div>\n<p>After the lesson, I asked the audience what they thought about the course material. Several of them said it was great, but many told me they wouldn&#8217;t have understood the relationship between the parent and child theme without being able to visually make the connection. In general, they understood the child theme concept and why it&#8217;s not a good idea to make changes to just the parent theme.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.org Vetted Training Material</h3>\n<p>If the training module concept takes off, it could open up a new set of opportunities for those looking to contribute to WordPress. Those who want to teach WordPress would be able to use the vetted material on WordPress.org instead of paying for it or directing students to videos and tutorials on the web. By stringing modules together, you&#8217;d be able to have detailed lessons and classes on different subjects. Users could openly learn together or from each other.</p>\n<p>Even though work is ongoing for the <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/">WordPress theme developer handbook</a>, it&#8217;s not meant to be used in a classroom environment. Modules are meant to be used to teach in a live situation while the handbooks are more like a detailed reference guide.</p>\n<h3>How You Can Get Involved</h3>\n<p>The team meets up every Tuesday at <strong>18:00 UTC</strong> on IRC within the <strong>#wordpress-getinvolved</strong> channel. Problems, agenda, and course material are some of the items discussed on a weekly basis. If you&#8217;re interested in teaching people how to do things with WordPress, the team wants to hear from you!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 23 May 2014 20:37:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"Alex King: WP Think Tank";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://pinboard-b4e23d3131f07e6b6d79af0c08d62a81";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"http://wpthinktank.com/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:238:"<p>I will be participating in the WP Think Tank round table discussion next Thursday.

It helps keep things a little more streamlined on multi-author sites where many authors are publishing and regularly adding files to the media library.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-users-media/" target="_blank">WP Users Media</a> is a new plugin that disables the ability for all users to access each other&#8217;s files and attachments via the Media menu and Featured Image links.</p>\n<p>I tested it with WP 3.9.1 and found that it works exactly as advertised. The admin can see all the media files, but other users will only see the ones they have uploaded.</p>\n<p>For example, in the screnshot below, you&#8217;ll see that an author on the site can see that there are 22 images in the media library.

The event&#8217;s organization team announced this week that this year&#8217;s camp will be a &#8220;developer edition,&#8221; catering to the area&#8217;s tech community.</p>\n<p>The day will be focused on topics for designers and developers who build with WordPress. Attendees will have the opportunity to explore tools available within WordPress, as well as third-party technology that can work with the software.</p>\n<p>I spoke with WordCamp Vancouver Organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/thoronas" target="_blank">Flynn O&#8217;Connor</a> who explained why they&#8217;ve changed this year&#8217;s event to be dev-focused:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Part of the goal was to reach out to other devs within the tech community in Vancouver in the hopes we could help reduce some of the detrimental assumptions about WordPress and what it can do that are prevalent in the greater community. When I go to non-WordPress tech conference I hear a lot of ignorance or outdated info about WordPress bandied about and we&#8217;d like to combat that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordCamp Vancouver has sold out every year and the organizers expect that it will again. The event was born out of a thriving local WordPress meetup which currently has 1200 members. The meetup is so large that they have split it into three &#8220;tracks,&#8221; including one for new WordPress users, general design/dev, and a developer focused meetup. Flynn said that because the city is so close to Portland and Seattle, they tend to get a fair number of cross-border attendees which has helped to boost their numbers.</p>\n<p>The first developer camp they held was in 2011 and it sold out just like the other more traditional WordCamps. WordCamp Vancouver &#8220;Developer Edition&#8221; 2014 will have a limit of 300 tickets (the same as last year), due to venue limitations. &#8220;We have explored other, potentially larger venues,&#8221; Flynn said. &#8220;But we have a good relationship with our current venue and would prefer to focus on other aspects of the WordCamp experience such as speaker outreach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Vancouver is situated in a city with a large WordPress community and draws from the entire region&#8217;s diverse talent pool, with speakers and attendees shared between events in both Seattle and Portland. This highly-anticipated event is well-known for bringing in a world-class lineup of speakers. WordCamp Vancouver has some generous sponsors who have allowed the organizers to hire a professional video production team, so all of the sessions will be recorded for those who cannot attend.</p>\n<p>Tickets for the one-day event will go on sale next week with an early bird special of $20. The seats are limited so make sure to <a href="http://2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">subscribe for updates</a> if you&#8217;re planning to attend.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 23 May 2014 15:02:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"bbPress: 2014 bbPress Survey Results";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://bbpress.org/?p=146684";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16491:"<p>This report presents the results from the 2014 bbPress Survey held from March 7 – April 11, 2014.

Discover current and actual bbPress usage.<br />\n2. Provide users the opportunity to post their feature requests.<br />\n3. Identify key areas for improvement.<br />\n4. Prioritize areas of bbPress development.<br />\n5. Set benchmarks to streamline development processes.<br />\n6. Identify volunteers who are interested in contributing to bbPress development.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>A couple of days after the <a title="2014 BuddyPress Survey" href="http://buddypress.org/2014/01/2014-buddypress-survey/">2014 BuddyPress Survey</a> was launched earlier this year, we started to set up a similar survey for bbPress per preliminary discussions in November and late December last year.</p>\n<p>I prepared general questions to be used for the survey which <a href="http://bbpress.org/forums/profile/johnjamesjacoby/">@johnjamesjacoby</a> and <a href="http://bbpress.org/forums/profile/netweb/">@netweb</a> reviewed and revised as needed. The chosen survey questions were categorized and ready by January 19th.</p>\n<p>The BuddyPress Survey was still ongoing then, so the bbPress Survey was scheduled sometime after the publication of the <a title="results of the 2014 BuddyPress Survey" href="http://buddypress.org/2014/03/2014-buddypress-survey-results/">2014 BuddyPress Survey Results</a>. Sure enough, a few days after the results were published, <a href="http://bbpress.org/forums/profile/johnjamesjacoby/">@johnjamesjacoby</a> launched the <a title="2014 bbPress survey launch" href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/2014-bbpress-survey/">2014 bbPress Survey</a>.</p>\n<h2>Survey Method/Design</h2>\n<p>We chose twenty-four questions for inclusion in the survey and grouped them in three sections namely: 1) You and bbPress, 2) Features and Participation, and 3) Opinions and Requests. All of the questions were directly related to the goal and objectives of the survey and the feedback generated would help guide the direction of bbPress development this year.</p>\n<p>The online survey was created using <a title="Polldaddy.com" href="http://polldaddy.com">Polldaddy.com</a>, a service that provides polling widgets for blogs, websites, and social networks. A variety of survey question types were employed to gather the data required: multiple choices, check boxes, free text, email address box, and open‐ended questions.</p>\n<p>Prior to analyzing the data collected, empty forms were deleted and submissions marked as &#8220;incomplete responses&#8221; were reviewed individually. Submissions which had no responses in the second and third pages of the survey &#8211; 27 in all &#8211; were excluded from this report.</p>\n<h2>Key Findings</h2>\n<p>1. <strong>Ninety-eight percent of respondents have sites running on the latest WordPress version</strong> (3.8 at time of survey).</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Thirty-four percent of respondents are bbPress &#8220;veterans&#8221;</strong> who installed the legacy stand-alone forums software (versions 0.7.2 through 1.x.x). They are still going strong in 2014 with 10% still using the legacy software (versions 0.9.x &#8211; 1.x.x) in production sites while the rest have either upgraded from legacy to the bbPress plugin versions or are no longer using the old legacy forums.</p>\n<p><img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/bbpress-version.jpg" alt="bar chart of bbPress versions used" /></p>\n<p>3. <strong>Close to half of the respondents find it &#8220;Easy&#8221; to set up bbPress</strong>. Add those to the group who found setting up bbPress &#8220;Very Easy&#8221; and you have 79% of users who have positive experiences setting up bbPress forums.</p>\n<p><img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/easy-pie.jpg" alt="bbpress set up is easy as pie" /></p>\n<p>4. <strong>The most popular forum set up is at the domain root of a WordPress installation.</strong></p>\n<p><img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/bbpress-wp.jpg" alt="popular bbPress set up" /></p>\n<p>5. <strong> English is used by 79% of respondents for their forums</strong>.<br />\nFurther evaluations reveal that 61% of respondents use only English in their forums, 20% develop only non-English forums, and the remaining 19% use English and other languages in their forums. Popular languages include: German, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Danish, Portugese, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, Slovak, Swedish, Arabic, Croatian, Greek, Indonesian, Norwegian, and Serbian<br />\n<img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/languages.jpg" alt="bbPress in your language" /></p>\n<p>6. <strong>Twenty-three percent of participants have not added any bbPress add-on plugins nor custom code at the time of survey</strong>. Additional research showed the majority of those who have not installed such are those who use bbPress for their own sites.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the participants, there are a few who mentioned that they have too many plugins in their installations to list in the survey form. For those who shared what plugins they have activated in their installations, following shows the top ten plugins which are either bbPress-specific or those with expressed support for bbPress.<br />\n<img class="alignright" src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/plugins.jpg" alt="visualization of plugins used" /></p>\n<p>a) GD bbPress Attachments<br />\nb) GD bbPress Tools<br />\nc) bbPress Enable TinyMCE Visual Tab<br />\nd) BuddyPress<br />\ne) Buddy-bbPress Support Topic<br />\nf) Custom private code<br />\ng) bbPress &#8211; Private Replies<br />\nh) bbPress Stay Checked<br />\ni) bbPress Topics for Posts<br />\nj) bbPress &#8211; Mark As Read</p>\n<p>7. <strong>More than half of the respondents prefer themes which are responsive, compatible with the latest bbPress version and have light &amp; fresh designs.</strong><br />\n<img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/preferred-themes.jpg" alt="bbPress theme preferences" /></p>\n<p>8. <strong>Twenty-three participants from 14 countries signed up to contribute to bbPress development.</strong> Thank you! We will be contacting you soon.<br />\n<img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/volunteers.jpg" alt="country flag of volunteers" /></p>\n<p>9. <strong>Eighty-eight percent evaluated other forum software before choosing bbPress</strong>. Forums evaluated were: 1) phpBB forums, 2) SimplePress plugin, 3) Vanilla forums, and 4) vbulletin forums, among others.</p>\n<p>10. <strong>Top Improvements or New Features requested are</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Chosen</th>\n<th>Write-ins</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Attachments<br />\nUnread Replies<br />\nModeration tools in the front end<br />\nQuotes<br />\nAjaxification of Topics and Replies<br />\nTopic/Reply Ratings</td>\n<td>Traditional forums layout &#8211; Categories<br />\nBetter support in forums<br />\nPermissions system<br />\nMore than one forum limit per BuddyPress Group<br />\nMore user-friendly<br />\nNeeds better documentation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>11. <strong>Forty-two percent of participants left interesting comments about bbPress and the survey</strong> including follow-ups on features requested/desired, among others.

At that time he also created a <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/102443414555578608628" target="_blank">WordPress Entrepreneur group</a> on Google+ to help connect those whose businesses are based on WordPress.</p>\n<p>Medeiros is the host of the <a href="http://mattreport.com/" target="_blank">Matt Report</a>, a WordPress business podcast for entrepreneurs, startups, and freelancers. His show specializes in exploring the paths entrepreneurs have taken on their journeys to launching WordPress-related businesses. In the past year he&#8217;s watched the WordPress Entrepreneurs Group grow to become a thriving community with more than 500 members.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23402" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress-entrepreneurs.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23282]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress-entrepreneurs.jpg?resize=1025%2C550" alt="WordPress Entrepreneurs Group" class="size-full wp-image-23402" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress Entrepreneurs Group</p></div>\n<p>I spoke with Medeiros, who said he that he fully expected that the group would grow to become quite large. &#8220;There&#8217;s still room to grow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Based on the audience of the Matt Report, I knew there was a need to launch a channel on a more accessible platform like Google+.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Entrepreneurs Group Provides a Safe Place to Ask Questions</h3>\n<p>The purpose of the group is to foster a greater sense of community among the business-spirited folks in WordPress. &#8220;A lot of my efforts in the WordPress world are to help connect like minded people,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;You find a lot of people chatting about their practice, agency or product. Then you find others coming in asking for some business help.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What kinds of conversations are happening in the WordPress Entrepreneurs Group? &#8220;There&#8217;s the typical SEO, conversion, and marketing advice you come to expect from a community like this,&#8221; Medeiros said. But where this group really shines is when members provide each other with feedback and share personal stories about their lives as entrepreneurs.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23428" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/business-coffee.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23282]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/business-coffee.jpg?resize=1022%2C488" alt="photo credit: DaveFayram - cc" class="size-full wp-image-23428" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davefayram/4326574134/">DaveFayram</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>In leading the group, Medeiros has been able to gain a greater understanding of what WordPress business people are looking for when they join a community. His experience shows that many business owners are in search of a place where they can feel comfortable asking each other questions about situations they are facing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I mentioned fear before and that&#8217;s a big one that a lot of people are &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; afraid to talk about. Fear paralyzes someone to launch their product, share their code or market their idea. As we all know, sometimes the criticism in the WP world can be quite harsh. Folks who are starting out are looking for a place where they can be accepted and ask the questions they have, no matter how trivial. </p>\n<p>A lot of folks are looking for a sounding board to bounce ideas off of one another and that&#8217;s great too. At the end of the day, they are looking for a place where they can meet others sharing the same journey as their own. </p></blockquote>\n<p>As the community grows, Medeiros is hoping to continue cultivating a safe place where members can get help finding their way in the world of business. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">On the inside, I hope that people can get their questions answered and their fears extinguished.</span> On the outside, I hope that investors and other businesses see WordPress entrepreneurs in a new light.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If Medeiros is right, the business climate for WordPress entrepreneurs right now is headed &#8220;up and to the right,&#8221; an assessment he&#8217;s made based on the large number of companies and individuals who are hiring and/or looking for work. &#8220;I talk to a lot of people in this space so I see new products/services everyday,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That means that there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity, but also a lot of competition.&#8221; His advice for businesses looking for success in the WordPress community? <strong>&#8220;Companies that not only create amazing products, but amazing stories and customer experiences will do just fine around here.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Medeiros invites anyone who is looking to connect with other like-minded business folks to join the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/102443414555578608628" target="_blank">WordPress Entrepreneurs Group</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great place to take the business track discussion after a WordCamp is over.&#8221; The group is open to beginners and advanced business owners who want to help each other go farther with their WordPress-related products and services.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 22 May 2014 22:39:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"WPTavern: VVV Site Wizard Automates the Creation and Deletion of WordPress Development Sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23348";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:228:"http://wptavern.com/vvv-site-wizard-automates-the-creation-and-deletion-of-wordpress-development-sites?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=vvv-site-wizard-automates-the-creation-and-deletion-of-wordpress-development-sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3963:"<div id="attachment_23352" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wizard.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23348]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wizard.jpg?resize=1025%2C493" alt="photo credit: i is Ashby - cc" class="size-full wp-image-23352" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnashby/368501428/">i is Ashby</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a> for WordPress development, the <a href="https://github.com/aliso/vvv-site-wizard" target="_blank">VVV Site Wizard</a>, created by <a href="http://alisothegeek.com/" target="_blank">Alison Barrett</a>, is a must-have tool for setting up new sites and deleting old ones. It&#8217;s a bash script that completely automates the otherwise lengthy process of <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/wiki/Add-New-Domain" target="_blank">adding a new site to VVV</a>.</p>\n<p>If you already have VVV up and running on your machine, download the wizard script:</p>\n<p><code>git clone https://github.com/aliso/vvv-site-wizard.git</code></p>\n<p>You can run ./vvv from the directory where you placed the script, but if you want to run it from any directory and not have to enter the path to VVV every time, you can edit the vvv root in the vvv-site-wizard/vvv script. Uncomment the line that begins with path= and add the path to your VVV setup. You&#8217;ll find it at the very top of the file:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/path-to-vvv-root.png" rel="prettyphoto[23348]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/path-to-vvv-root.png?resize=1000%2C363" alt="path-to-vvv-root" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23371" /></a></p>\n<p>You may also need to edit your bashrc file to make sure you can run vvv from a folder included in your PATH environment variable. Save and refesh your terminal and you should be good to launch your new site wizard.</p>\n<p>The script&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/aliso/vvv-site-wizard" target="_blank">Github homepage</a> includes a list of options available for the vvv command, including site creation and teardown, setting the domain and site name, whether or not to provision vagrant or just create the site directory/files, path, the WordPress version to install, and the option to turn on WP_DEBUG and WP_DEBUG_LOG.</p>\n<p>However, none of these options are required. If there&#8217;s a required piece of information missing from your original command, the script, in true wizard fashion, will prompt you for it, as shown below:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vvv-site-wizard.png" rel="prettyphoto[23348]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vvv-site-wizard.png?resize=900%2C546" alt="vvv-site-wizard" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23374" /></a></p>\n<p>Once you proceed, the wizard will go about doing all the work of creating your new development site, including setting up the file in the nginx-config folder and creating the vvv-init.sh, wp-cli.yml, and vvv-hosts files.

The Partnership agreement has been structured to provide the investors (limited partners) with maximum protection. As General Partner, Acorn General Manager (Pty) Ltd does not have the benefit of limited liability.\r\n\r\n<strong>Investment size</strong>\r\nAcorn has identified the opportunity to invest in very promising Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that fall outside the mandates of the larger institutional private equity investors. This relatively untapped market has arisen due to the targeted deal sizes of most private equity houses in South Africa that are currently focusing on larger transactions (in excess of R100m). Acorn will focus on deals below R100 million and, as a result, have limited competitors and be more likely to negotiate favourable prices with target companies. This also bodes well for deal flow. Acorn will, however, also look at larger deals if the opportunity is attractive. In such cases, alternative options such as co-investment or investment through an SPV shall be considered.\r\n\r\n<strong>Deal flow</strong>\r\nAcorn has endeavoured to align itself with several key players in the targeted investment markets to ensure on-going deal flow and maintain a competitive advantage. These strategic alliances further provide invaluable insight into a wide spectrum of promising industries.\r\n\r\n<strong>Investment track record</strong>\r\nThe Acorn managers have proven track records of delivery and performance in the industry. It is worth mentioning that the principal of Acorn has shown historic annualised returns in excess of 62% for the 7 years ending February 2009 whilst at PSG. Although Acorn will not attempt to match these exceptional returns, it is an indication of the ability of the key individuals to achieve superior returns over a long-term period.\r\n\r\n<strong>Positioning and timing</strong>\r\n<em>“History shows that the best private equity funds are born after the ends of recessions.” David Snow. </em>\r\n\r\nAcorn has positioned itself to take advantage of the current pricing in the markets and is able to enter into transactions on very favourable terms. The current economic situation has created opportunities to build a very profitable portfolio at substantially discounted prices. Acorn will also apply appropriate exit strategies to take advantage of the market cycles and maximise partners’ returns once the markets and economies have stabilised.\r\n\r\n<strong>Market knowledge</strong>\r\nThe key individuals of Acorn Equity have in-depth private equity experience and a strong understanding of Southern African markets.\r\n\r\n<strong>Superior governance</strong>\r\nAcorn has chosen to be a FSB registered investment manager. This is not a requirement for Acorn, but serves as a strong governance process to provide comfort and security to all investors. Acorn is absolutely committed to doing business in an ethical way, and will act honestly and ethically in all of its dealings and negotiations with business partners. In addition, Acorn has also opted to outsource its compliance function to Moonstone Compliance (Pty) Ltd - an independent provider.\r\n\r\n<strong>Selective deal making</strong>\r\nAcorn will be very selective in the transactions that it enters into. Acorn’s strong deal flow potential will allow us the luxury of being selective about the investments we make. Up to two seats on our investment committee will be made available to Partners invited at the discretion of Acorn. This will allow those partners to contribute and partake in the management and decision making processes at a strategic level. Acorn will also appoint independent non-executive members to the investment committee.\r\n\r\n<strong>Strict risk management</strong>\r\nAcorn will endeavour to achieve returns superior to the industry standard without assuming additional or unnecessary risk through its investments. Acorn will not enter into potential high-return transactions if the risk is deemed to outweigh the potential returns of the transaction. All partners need to accept that a higher degree of risk is inherent in the industry, but that Acorn will strictly manage and limit that risk, within reason.\r\n\r\n<strong>Creative approach to acquisitions and operational expertise</strong>\r\nThe Acorn team has proven its ability and experience in being creative and innovative when it comes to the structuring of acquisitions, the disposals of investments and the closing of transactions.', 'Why Acorn', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'why-acorn', '', '', '2014-05-06 13:59:29', '2014-05-06 11:59:29', '', 5, 'http://localhost/~tyronestafford/acorn/?page_id=40', 0, 'page', '', 0),

(68, 1, '2014-04-24 11:27:11', '2014-04-24 09:27:11', 'Acorn provides several defining and differentiating qualities to our investors and our targeted investee companies:\n\n<strong>Alignment of interest</strong>\nAcorn is and will be a significant investor into each of its funds and will therefore have the same interests at heart as our fellow investors. The Partnership agreement has been structured to provide the investors (limited partners) with maximum protection. As General Partner, Acorn General Manager (Pty) Ltd does not have the benefit of limited liability.\n\n<strong>Investment size</strong>\nAcorn has identified the opportunity to invest in very promising Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that fall outside the mandates of the larger institutional private equity investors. This relatively untapped market has arisen due to the targeted deal sizes of most private equity houses in South Africa that are currently focusing on larger transactions (in excess of R100m). Acorn will focus on deals below R100 million and, as a result, have limited competitors and be more likely to negotiate favourable prices with target companies. This also bodes well for deal flow. Acorn will, however, also look at larger deals if the opportunity is attractive. In such cases, alternative options such as co-investment or investment through an SPV shall be considered.\n\n<strong>Deal flow</strong>\nAcorn has endeavoured to align itself with several key players in the targeted investment markets to ensure on-going deal flow and maintain a competitive advantage. These strategic alliances further provide invaluable insight into a wide spectrum of promising industries.\n\n<strong>Investment track record</strong>\nThe Acorn managers have proven track records of delivery and performance in the industry. It is worth mentioning that the principal of Acorn has shown historic annualised returns in excess of 62% for the 7 years ending February 2009 whilst at PSG. Although Acorn will not attempt to match these exceptional returns, it is an indication of the ability of the key individuals to achieve superior returns over a long-term period.\n\n<strong>Positioning and timing</strong>\n<em>“History shows that the best private equity funds are born after the ends of recessions.” David Snow. </em>\n\nAcorn has positioned itself to take advantage of the current pricing in the markets and is able to enter into transactions on very favourable terms. The current economic situation has created opportunities to build a very profitable portfolio at substantially discounted prices. Acorn will also apply appropriate exit strategies to take advantage of the market cycles and maximise partners’ returns once the markets and economies have stabilised.\n\n<strong>Market knowledge</strong>\nThe key individuals of Acorn Equity have in-depth private equity experience and a strong understanding of Southern African markets.\n\n<strong>Superior governance</strong>\nAcorn has chosen to be a FSB registered investment manager. This is not a requirement for Acorn, but serves as a strong governance process to provide comfort and security to all investors. Acorn is absolutely committed to doing business in an ethical way, and will act honestly and ethically in all of its dealings and negotiations with business partners. In addition, Acorn has also opted to outsource its compliance function to Moonstone Compliance (Pty) Ltd - an independent provider.\n\n<strong>Selective deal making</strong>\nAcorn will be very selective in the transactions that it enters into.

(69, 1, '2014-04-10 11:00:33', '2014-04-10 11:00:33', 'Acorn provides several defining and differentiating qualities to our investors and our targeted investee companies:\r\n\r\n<strong>Alignment of interest</strong>\r\nAcorn is and will be a significant investor into each of its funds and will therefore have the same interests at heart as our fellow investors. The Partnership agreement has been structured to provide the investors (limited partners) with maximum protection. As General Partner, Acorn General Manager (Pty) Ltd does not have the benefit of limited liability.\r\n\r\n<strong>Investment size</strong>\r\nAcorn has identified the opportunity to invest in very promising Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that fall outside the mandates of the larger institutional private equity investors. This relatively untapped market has arisen due to the targeted deal sizes of most private equity houses in South Africa that are currently focusing on larger transactions (in excess of R100m). Acorn will focus on deals below R100 million and, as a result, have limited competitors and be more likely to negotiate favourable prices with target companies. This also bodes well for deal flow. Acorn will, however, also look at larger deals if the opportunity is attractive. In such cases alternative options such as co-investment or investment through an SPV shall be considered.\r\n\r\n<strong>Deal flow</strong>\r\nAcorn has endeavoured to align itself with several key players in the targeted investment markets to ensure on-going deal flow and maintain a competitive advantage. These strategic alliances further provide invaluable insight into a wide spectrum of promising industries.\r\n\r\n<strong>Investment track record</strong>\r\nThe Acorn managers have proven track records of delivery and performance in the industry. It is worth mentioning that the principal of Acorn has shown historic annualised returns in excess of 62% for the 7 years ending February 2009 whilst at PSG. Although Acorn will not attempt to match these exceptional returns, it is an indication of the ability of the key individuals to achieve superior returns over a long-term period.\r\n\r\n<strong>Positioning and timing</strong>\r\n<em>“History shows that the best private equity funds are born after the ends of recessions.” David Snow. </em>\r\n\r\nAcorn has positioned itself to take advantage of the current pricing in the markets and is able to enter into transactions on very favourable terms. The current economic situation has created opportunities to build a very profitable portfolio at substantially discounted prices. Acorn will also apply appropriate exit strategies to take advantage of the market cycles and maximise partners’ returns once the markets and economies have stabilised.\r\n\r\n<strong>Market knowledge</strong>\r\nThe key individuals of Acorn Equity have in-depth private equity experience and a strong understanding of Southern African markets.\r\n\r\n<strong>Superior governance</strong>\r\nAcorn has chosen to be a FSB registered investment manager. This is not a requirement for Acorn but serves as a strong governance process to provide comfort and security to all investors. Acorn is absolutely committed to doing business in an ethical way, and will act honestly and ethically in all of its dealings and negotiations with business partners. In addition, Acorn has also opted to outsource its compliance function to Moonstone Compliance (Pty) Ltd - an independent provider.\r\n\r\n<strong>Selective deal making</strong>\r\nAcorn will be very selective in the transactions that it enters into. Acorn’s strong deal flow potential will allow us the luxury of being selective about the investments we make. Up to two seats on our investment committee will be made available to Partners invited at the discretion of Acorn. This will allow those partners to contribute and partake in the management and decision making processes at a strategic level.

In 1994 he joined stockbrokers SMK Securities. In April 1996 he moved to Corporate Finance where he was involved in mergers and acquisitions, new listings, structured finance, rights issues and management buyouts. In January 1998 he was promoted to Director: Corporate Finance of BOE Securities. In September 1998 Pierre started the Corporate Finance function in PSG Investment Bank and worked on new listings, mergers and acquisitions, capital raisings, restructurings and general advice. After the disposal of PSG Investment Bank in June 2002, Pierre assisted in the set-up and creation of PSG Capital as an Executive Director tasked with private equity and corporate finance. In 2006 he joined the PSG Group main board and started PSG’s dedicated private equity investment vehicle, Paladin Capital Ltd. as CEO.

Through Carl´s dealings with Whitehall and Goldman Sachs, he was subsequently recruited to the head-offices of the Westmont Group in London. He was the global investment controller on their private equity ventures.

His excellent track record, along with his contacts and relationships within the industry are priceless qualities that very few private equity funds can boast of. Pierre and Carl are listed as key individuals with the FSB.\r\n\r\nBRIEF HISTORY: Pierre specialised in taxation with Arthur Andersen in 1992 and during this time became involved in structured and project finance. In 1994, he joined stockbrokers SMK Securities. In April 1996, he moved to Corporate Finance where he was involved in mergers and acquisitions, new listings, structured finance, rights issues and management buyouts. In January 1998, he was promoted to Director: Corporate Finance of BOE Securities. In September 1998, Pierre started the Corporate Finance function in PSG Investment Bank and worked on new listings, mergers and acquisitions, capital raisings, restructurings and general advice. After the disposal of PSG Investment Bank in June 2002, Pierre assisted in the set-up and creation of PSG Capital as an Executive Director tasked with private equity and corporate finance. In 2006, he joined the PSG Group main board and started PSG’s dedicated private equity investment vehicle, Paladin Capital Ltd. as CEO. Under his guidance, the company grew from R280m of assets under management to a value in excess of R800m in February 2009, when he resigned to start Acorn Private Equity.\r\n\r\n[/colleft]\r\n\r\n[colright]\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://192.168.1.15/~tyronestafford/acorn/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dummy_team.jpg" alt="dummy_team" width="195" height="230" /></p>\r\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Carl Neethling\r\n</strong><em>Chief Investment Officer</em></p>\r\nCarl is a qualified chartered accountant with several years of successful private equity and investment experience at international level.

Carl and Pierre are listed as key individuals with the FSB.\r\n\r\nBRIEF HISTORY: Carl comes from a strong entrepreneurial and family business background.

Through Carl´s dealings with Whitehall and Goldman Sachs, he was subsequently recruited to the head-offices of the Westmont Group in London. He was the global investment controller on their private equity ventures. Westmont is one of the largest privately owned investors in private equity in the world with several billion US dollars under management.
