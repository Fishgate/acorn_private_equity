(For example: <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/15/html5-galleries-captions-in-wordpress-3-9/">HTML5</a>, <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/14/symlinked-plugins-in-wordpress-3-9/">symlinks</a>, <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/07/mysql-in-wordpress-3-9/">MySQL</a>, <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/11/plupload-2-x-in-wordpress-3-9/">Plupload</a>.)</p>\n<p>To test WordPress 3.9 RC2, try the <a href="//wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”).

We&#8217;re sorry we let you down.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all lost words we&#8217;ve written before, like an email thanks to a cat on the keyboard or a term paper to a blue screen of death. Over the last few WordPress releases, we&#8217;ve made a number of improvements to features like autosaves and revisions. With revisions, an old edit can always be restored. We&#8217;re trying our hardest to save your content somewhere even if your power goes out or your browser crashes. We even monitor your internet connection and prevent you from hitting that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button at the exact moment the coffee shop Wi-Fi has a hiccup.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the quick draft you lost last week is still in the database, and just hidden from view. As an added complication, these &#8220;discarded drafts&#8221; normally get deleted after seven days, and it&#8217;s already been six days since the release. If we were able to rescue your draft, you&#8217;ll see it on the &#8220;All Posts&#8221; screen after you update to 3.8.3. (We&#8217;ll also be pushing 3.8.3 out as a background update, so you may just see a draft appear.)</p>\n<p>So, if you tried to jot down a quick idea last week, I hope WordPress has recovered it for you.

By activating Hide Plugins, you will be able to see all plugins and a toggle to hide each plugin from other users on the Plugins page.

For example, if you have written 90 words, the editor color would be light red and when you cross the 100 words limit, it changes to yellow. After 300 words, it automatically changes to green to indicate you&#8217;ve reached your goal.</p>\n<h2>WPWeekly Meta:</h2>\n<p><strong>Next Episode:</strong> Friday, May 30th 3 P.M.

The modules explain all the aspects of developing, editing, and learning about themes.</p>\n<p>Despite a lot of excitement and interest at the beginning of the project, most of the work has been completed by Tracy Levasque and Courtney OCallaghan. Shortly after contributor day, the two were given <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/training/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/">their own site</a> as a sub-group of the WordPress Community group.</p>\n<p>The proposed <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/training/theme-curriculum/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/theme-curriculum/">curriculum</a> covers everything from explaining what a theme is, to creating and altering child themes. The basic layout of each module contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a short intro in what you will learn (written or video)</li>\n<li>voice over screencast walk through (user could follow along if they wanted to)</li>\n<li>2-3 practice examples</li>\n<li>self quiz for each topic</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Results Of Using The Module For The First Time</h3>\n<p>The <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/training/modules-in-progress/child-theme-module/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/training/modules-in-progress/child-theme-module/">Child Theme module</a> is the first to be nearly completed. The module is structured in such a way that it&#8217;s like a lesson planner for school. I used it to teach 20 members of our local WordPress meetup why it&#8217;s important to use child themes. I read the module text and performed the exercises while everyone in the room watched the projector. It wasn&#8217;t until we reached the point where attendees could see the child theme manipulating the parent theme, when they finally understood the concept.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23450" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ChildModuleDiagram.png" rel="prettyphoto[23344]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23450" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ChildModuleDiagram.png?resize=686%2C246" alt="Diagram Showing The Loading Sequence Of WP Themes" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Diagram Showing The Loading Sequence Of WP Themes</p></div>\n<p>After the lesson, I asked the audience what they thought about the course material. Several of them said it was great, but many told me they wouldn&#8217;t have understood the relationship between the parent and child theme without being able to visually make the connection. In general, they understood the child theme concept and why it&#8217;s not a good idea to make changes to just the parent theme.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.org Vetted Training Material</h3>\n<p>If the training module concept takes off, it could open up a new set of opportunities for those looking to contribute to WordPress. Those who want to teach WordPress would be able to use the vetted material on WordPress.org instead of paying for it or directing students to videos and tutorials on the web. By stringing modules together, you&#8217;d be able to have detailed lessons and classes on different subjects. Users could openly learn together or from each other.</p>\n<p>Even though work is ongoing for the <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/" href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/">WordPress theme developer handbook</a>, it&#8217;s not meant to be used in a classroom environment. Modules are meant to be used to teach in a live situation while the handbooks are more like a detailed reference guide.</p>\n<h3>How You Can Get Involved</h3>\n<p>The team meets up every Tuesday at <strong>18:00 UTC</strong> on IRC within the <strong>#wordpress-getinvolved</strong> channel. Problems, agenda, and course material are some of the items discussed on a weekly basis. If you&#8217;re interested in teaching people how to do things with WordPress, the team wants to hear from you!</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 23 May 2014 20:37:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"Alex King: WP Think Tank";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:48:"http://pinboard-b4e23d3131f07e6b6d79af0c08d62a81";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"http://wpthinktank.com/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:238:"<p>I will be participating in the WP Think Tank round table discussion next Thursday.

It helps keep things a little more streamlined on multi-author sites where many authors are publishing and regularly adding files to the media library.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-users-media/" target="_blank">WP Users Media</a> is a new plugin that disables the ability for all users to access each other&#8217;s files and attachments via the Media menu and Featured Image links.</p>\n<p>I tested it with WP 3.9.1 and found that it works exactly as advertised. The admin can see all the media files, but other users will only see the ones they have uploaded.</p>\n<p>For example, in the screnshot below, you&#8217;ll see that an author on the site can see that there are 22 images in the media library.

The event&#8217;s organization team announced this week that this year&#8217;s camp will be a &#8220;developer edition,&#8221; catering to the area&#8217;s tech community.</p>\n<p>The day will be focused on topics for designers and developers who build with WordPress. Attendees will have the opportunity to explore tools available within WordPress, as well as third-party technology that can work with the software.</p>\n<p>I spoke with WordCamp Vancouver Organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/thoronas" target="_blank">Flynn O&#8217;Connor</a> who explained why they&#8217;ve changed this year&#8217;s event to be dev-focused:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Part of the goal was to reach out to other devs within the tech community in Vancouver in the hopes we could help reduce some of the detrimental assumptions about WordPress and what it can do that are prevalent in the greater community. When I go to non-WordPress tech conference I hear a lot of ignorance or outdated info about WordPress bandied about and we&#8217;d like to combat that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordCamp Vancouver has sold out every year and the organizers expect that it will again. The event was born out of a thriving local WordPress meetup which currently has 1200 members. The meetup is so large that they have split it into three &#8220;tracks,&#8221; including one for new WordPress users, general design/dev, and a developer focused meetup. Flynn said that because the city is so close to Portland and Seattle, they tend to get a fair number of cross-border attendees which has helped to boost their numbers.</p>\n<p>The first developer camp they held was in 2011 and it sold out just like the other more traditional WordCamps. WordCamp Vancouver &#8220;Developer Edition&#8221; 2014 will have a limit of 300 tickets (the same as last year), due to venue limitations. &#8220;We have explored other, potentially larger venues,&#8221; Flynn said. &#8220;But we have a good relationship with our current venue and would prefer to focus on other aspects of the WordCamp experience such as speaker outreach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordCamp Vancouver is situated in a city with a large WordPress community and draws from the entire region&#8217;s diverse talent pool, with speakers and attendees shared between events in both Seattle and Portland. This highly-anticipated event is well-known for bringing in a world-class lineup of speakers. WordCamp Vancouver has some generous sponsors who have allowed the organizers to hire a professional video production team, so all of the sessions will be recorded for those who cannot attend.</p>\n<p>Tickets for the one-day event will go on sale next week with an early bird special of $20. The seats are limited so make sure to <a href="http://2014.vancouver.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">subscribe for updates</a> if you&#8217;re planning to attend.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 23 May 2014 15:02:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"bbPress: 2014 bbPress Survey Results";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://bbpress.org/?p=146684";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/05/2014-bbpress-survey-results/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16491:"<p>This report presents the results from the 2014 bbPress Survey held from March 7 – April 11, 2014.

Discover current and actual bbPress usage.<br />\n2. Provide users the opportunity to post their feature requests.<br />\n3. Identify key areas for improvement.<br />\n4. Prioritize areas of bbPress development.<br />\n5. Set benchmarks to streamline development processes.<br />\n6. Identify volunteers who are interested in contributing to bbPress development.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>A couple of days after the <a title="2014 BuddyPress Survey" href="http://buddypress.org/2014/01/2014-buddypress-survey/">2014 BuddyPress Survey</a> was launched earlier this year, we started to set up a similar survey for bbPress per preliminary discussions in November and late December last year.</p>\n<p>I prepared general questions to be used for the survey which <a href="http://bbpress.org/forums/profile/johnjamesjacoby/">@johnjamesjacoby</a> and <a href="http://bbpress.org/forums/profile/netweb/">@netweb</a> reviewed and revised as needed. The chosen survey questions were categorized and ready by January 19th.</p>\n<p>The BuddyPress Survey was still ongoing then, so the bbPress Survey was scheduled sometime after the publication of the <a title="results of the 2014 BuddyPress Survey" href="http://buddypress.org/2014/03/2014-buddypress-survey-results/">2014 BuddyPress Survey Results</a>. Sure enough, a few days after the results were published, <a href="http://bbpress.org/forums/profile/johnjamesjacoby/">@johnjamesjacoby</a> launched the <a title="2014 bbPress survey launch" href="http://bbpress.org/blog/2014/03/2014-bbpress-survey/">2014 bbPress Survey</a>.</p>\n<h2>Survey Method/Design</h2>\n<p>We chose twenty-four questions for inclusion in the survey and grouped them in three sections namely: 1) You and bbPress, 2) Features and Participation, and 3) Opinions and Requests. All of the questions were directly related to the goal and objectives of the survey and the feedback generated would help guide the direction of bbPress development this year.</p>\n<p>The online survey was created using <a title="Polldaddy.com" href="http://polldaddy.com">Polldaddy.com</a>, a service that provides polling widgets for blogs, websites, and social networks. A variety of survey question types were employed to gather the data required: multiple choices, check boxes, free text, email address box, and open‐ended questions.</p>\n<p>Prior to analyzing the data collected, empty forms were deleted and submissions marked as &#8220;incomplete responses&#8221; were reviewed individually. Submissions which had no responses in the second and third pages of the survey &#8211; 27 in all &#8211; were excluded from this report.</p>\n<h2>Key Findings</h2>\n<p>1. <strong>Ninety-eight percent of respondents have sites running on the latest WordPress version</strong> (3.8 at time of survey).</p>\n<p>2. <strong>Thirty-four percent of respondents are bbPress &#8220;veterans&#8221;</strong> who installed the legacy stand-alone forums software (versions 0.7.2 through 1.x.x). They are still going strong in 2014 with 10% still using the legacy software (versions 0.9.x &#8211; 1.x.x) in production sites while the rest have either upgraded from legacy to the bbPress plugin versions or are no longer using the old legacy forums.</p>\n<p><img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/bbpress-version.jpg" alt="bar chart of bbPress versions used" /></p>\n<p>3. <strong>Close to half of the respondents find it &#8220;Easy&#8221; to set up bbPress</strong>. Add those to the group who found setting up bbPress &#8220;Very Easy&#8221; and you have 79% of users who have positive experiences setting up bbPress forums.</p>\n<p><img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/easy-pie.jpg" alt="bbpress set up is easy as pie" /></p>\n<p>4. <strong>The most popular forum set up is at the domain root of a WordPress installation.</strong></p>\n<p><img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/bbpress-wp.jpg" alt="popular bbPress set up" /></p>\n<p>5. <strong> English is used by 79% of respondents for their forums</strong>.<br />\nFurther evaluations reveal that 61% of respondents use only English in their forums, 20% develop only non-English forums, and the remaining 19% use English and other languages in their forums. Popular languages include: German, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Danish, Portugese, Russian, Turkish, Chinese, Slovak, Swedish, Arabic, Croatian, Greek, Indonesian, Norwegian, and Serbian<br />\n<img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/languages.jpg" alt="bbPress in your language" /></p>\n<p>6. <strong>Twenty-three percent of participants have not added any bbPress add-on plugins nor custom code at the time of survey</strong>. Additional research showed the majority of those who have not installed such are those who use bbPress for their own sites.</p>\n<p>For the rest of the participants, there are a few who mentioned that they have too many plugins in their installations to list in the survey form. For those who shared what plugins they have activated in their installations, following shows the top ten plugins which are either bbPress-specific or those with expressed support for bbPress.<br />\n<img class="alignright" src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/plugins.jpg" alt="visualization of plugins used" /></p>\n<p>a) GD bbPress Attachments<br />\nb) GD bbPress Tools<br />\nc) bbPress Enable TinyMCE Visual Tab<br />\nd) BuddyPress<br />\ne) Buddy-bbPress Support Topic<br />\nf) Custom private code<br />\ng) bbPress &#8211; Private Replies<br />\nh) bbPress Stay Checked<br />\ni) bbPress Topics for Posts<br />\nj) bbPress &#8211; Mark As Read</p>\n<p>7. <strong>More than half of the respondents prefer themes which are responsive, compatible with the latest bbPress version and have light &amp; fresh designs.</strong><br />\n<img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/preferred-themes.jpg" alt="bbPress theme preferences" /></p>\n<p>8. <strong>Twenty-three participants from 14 countries signed up to contribute to bbPress development.</strong> Thank you! We will be contacting you soon.<br />\n<img src="http://mercime.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/volunteers.jpg" alt="country flag of volunteers" /></p>\n<p>9. <strong>Eighty-eight percent evaluated other forum software before choosing bbPress</strong>. Forums evaluated were: 1) phpBB forums, 2) SimplePress plugin, 3) Vanilla forums, and 4) vbulletin forums, among others.</p>\n<p>10. <strong>Top Improvements or New Features requested are</strong>:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Chosen</th>\n<th>Write-ins</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Attachments<br />\nUnread Replies<br />\nModeration tools in the front end<br />\nQuotes<br />\nAjaxification of Topics and Replies<br />\nTopic/Reply Ratings</td>\n<td>Traditional forums layout &#8211; Categories<br />\nBetter support in forums<br />\nPermissions system<br />\nMore than one forum limit per BuddyPress Group<br />\nMore user-friendly<br />\nNeeds better documentation</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>11. <strong>Forty-two percent of participants left interesting comments about bbPress and the survey</strong> including follow-ups on features requested/desired, among others.

At that time he also created a <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/102443414555578608628" target="_blank">WordPress Entrepreneur group</a> on Google+ to help connect those whose businesses are based on WordPress.</p>\n<p>Medeiros is the host of the <a href="http://mattreport.com/" target="_blank">Matt Report</a>, a WordPress business podcast for entrepreneurs, startups, and freelancers. His show specializes in exploring the paths entrepreneurs have taken on their journeys to launching WordPress-related businesses. In the past year he&#8217;s watched the WordPress Entrepreneurs Group grow to become a thriving community with more than 500 members.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23402" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress-entrepreneurs.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23282]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wordpress-entrepreneurs.jpg?resize=1025%2C550" alt="WordPress Entrepreneurs Group" class="size-full wp-image-23402" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">WordPress Entrepreneurs Group</p></div>\n<p>I spoke with Medeiros, who said he that he fully expected that the group would grow to become quite large. &#8220;There&#8217;s still room to grow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Based on the audience of the Matt Report, I knew there was a need to launch a channel on a more accessible platform like Google+.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Entrepreneurs Group Provides a Safe Place to Ask Questions</h3>\n<p>The purpose of the group is to foster a greater sense of community among the business-spirited folks in WordPress. &#8220;A lot of my efforts in the WordPress world are to help connect like minded people,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;You find a lot of people chatting about their practice, agency or product. Then you find others coming in asking for some business help.&#8221;</p>\n<p>What kinds of conversations are happening in the WordPress Entrepreneurs Group? &#8220;There&#8217;s the typical SEO, conversion, and marketing advice you come to expect from a community like this,&#8221; Medeiros said. But where this group really shines is when members provide each other with feedback and share personal stories about their lives as entrepreneurs.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23428" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/business-coffee.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23282]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/business-coffee.jpg?resize=1022%2C488" alt="photo credit: DaveFayram - cc" class="size-full wp-image-23428" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davefayram/4326574134/">DaveFayram</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>In leading the group, Medeiros has been able to gain a greater understanding of what WordPress business people are looking for when they join a community. His experience shows that many business owners are in search of a place where they can feel comfortable asking each other questions about situations they are facing.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I mentioned fear before and that&#8217;s a big one that a lot of people are &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; afraid to talk about. Fear paralyzes someone to launch their product, share their code or market their idea. As we all know, sometimes the criticism in the WP world can be quite harsh. Folks who are starting out are looking for a place where they can be accepted and ask the questions they have, no matter how trivial. </p>\n<p>A lot of folks are looking for a sounding board to bounce ideas off of one another and that&#8217;s great too. At the end of the day, they are looking for a place where they can meet others sharing the same journey as their own. </p></blockquote>\n<p>As the community grows, Medeiros is hoping to continue cultivating a safe place where members can get help finding their way in the world of business. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">On the inside, I hope that people can get their questions answered and their fears extinguished.</span> On the outside, I hope that investors and other businesses see WordPress entrepreneurs in a new light.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If Medeiros is right, the business climate for WordPress entrepreneurs right now is headed &#8220;up and to the right,&#8221; an assessment he&#8217;s made based on the large number of companies and individuals who are hiring and/or looking for work. &#8220;I talk to a lot of people in this space so I see new products/services everyday,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That means that there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity, but also a lot of competition.&#8221; His advice for businesses looking for success in the WordPress community? <strong>&#8220;Companies that not only create amazing products, but amazing stories and customer experiences will do just fine around here.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>Medeiros invites anyone who is looking to connect with other like-minded business folks to join the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/102443414555578608628" target="_blank">WordPress Entrepreneurs Group</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great place to take the business track discussion after a WordCamp is over.&#8221; The group is open to beginners and advanced business owners who want to help each other go farther with their WordPress-related products and services.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 22 May 2014 22:39:42 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"WPTavern: VVV Site Wizard Automates the Creation and Deletion of WordPress Development Sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23348";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:228:"http://wptavern.com/vvv-site-wizard-automates-the-creation-and-deletion-of-wordpress-development-sites?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=vvv-site-wizard-automates-the-creation-and-deletion-of-wordpress-development-sites";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3963:"<div id="attachment_23352" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wizard.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23348]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/wizard.jpg?resize=1025%2C493" alt="photo credit: i is Ashby - cc" class="size-full wp-image-23352" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnashby/368501428/">i is Ashby</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">cc</a></p></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;re using <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV" target="_blank">Varying Vagrant Vagrants</a> for WordPress development, the <a href="https://github.com/aliso/vvv-site-wizard" target="_blank">VVV Site Wizard</a>, created by <a href="http://alisothegeek.com/" target="_blank">Alison Barrett</a>, is a must-have tool for setting up new sites and deleting old ones. It&#8217;s a bash script that completely automates the otherwise lengthy process of <a href="https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/wiki/Add-New-Domain" target="_blank">adding a new site to VVV</a>.</p>\n<p>If you already have VVV up and running on your machine, download the wizard script:</p>\n<p><code>git clone https://github.com/aliso/vvv-site-wizard.git</code></p>\n<p>You can run ./vvv from the directory where you placed the script, but if you want to run it from any directory and not have to enter the path to VVV every time, you can edit the vvv root in the vvv-site-wizard/vvv script. Uncomment the line that begins with path= and add the path to your VVV setup. You&#8217;ll find it at the very top of the file:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/path-to-vvv-root.png" rel="prettyphoto[23348]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/path-to-vvv-root.png?resize=1000%2C363" alt="path-to-vvv-root" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23371" /></a></p>\n<p>You may also need to edit your bashrc file to make sure you can run vvv from a folder included in your PATH environment variable. Save and refesh your terminal and you should be good to launch your new site wizard.</p>\n<p>The script&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/aliso/vvv-site-wizard" target="_blank">Github homepage</a> includes a list of options available for the vvv command, including site creation and teardown, setting the domain and site name, whether or not to provision vagrant or just create the site directory/files, path, the WordPress version to install, and the option to turn on WP_DEBUG and WP_DEBUG_LOG.</p>\n<p>However, none of these options are required. If there&#8217;s a required piece of information missing from your original command, the script, in true wizard fashion, will prompt you for it, as shown below:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vvv-site-wizard.png" rel="prettyphoto[23348]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/vvv-site-wizard.png?resize=900%2C546" alt="vvv-site-wizard" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23374" /></a></p>\n<p>Once you proceed, the wizard will go about doing all the work of creating your new development site, including setting up the file in the nginx-config folder and creating the vvv-init.sh, wp-cli.yml, and vvv-hosts files.

These concerns, though brought to the company&#8217;s attention multiple times by other customers, were roundly ignored until <a href="http://auditwp.com/wp-engine-seo-failboat/" target="_blank">publicized</a> by Audit WP&#8217;s founder, Jacob King.</p>\n<h3>WP Engine Responds to Customer Dissatisfaction: &#8220;Growth is Hard&#8221;</h3>\n<p>Mounting criticism of the company following these reviews has prompted the response penned today by WP Engine founder Jason Cohen, titled: &#8220;<a href="http://wpengine.com/2014/05/21/growth-hard/" target="_blank">Growth is Hard</a>.&#8221; The statement explains what the company has been doing in response to its slipping customer satisfaction rate.</p>\n<p>In January 2014, WP Engine <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/14/wp-engine-raises-15m-from-north-bridge-growth-equity-to-invest-in-product-development-accelerate-growth/" target="_blank">raised $15 million in funding</a> to supplement its rapid expansion. Cohen&#8217;s statement today indicates that the first priority for those funds was to hire additional staff:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We closed our Series C financing in January and immediately put it to work in hiring in the Support Team. We&#8217;ve increased the team by 50% since then. It’s very hard to hire quickly and yet maintain our standards of both attitude (culture) and aptitude (ability).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cohen&#8217;s post contains a rundown of how difficult it has been for the company to deal with its growth and enumerates what they&#8217;ve done to address the growing customer dissatisfaction, much of which has centered around the issue of support.</p>\n<p>A host that promises &#8220;hassle-free WordPress hosting&#8221; and caters to WordPress developers will need to deliver expert WordPress support in order to justify its pricing. In the early days of WP Engine, its customers raved about the top-notch WordPress experts available to assist them. Woodward&#8217;s review, however, indicates that this is no longer the case, illustrated by screenshots of WP Engine&#8217;s responses to tickets.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/db-comments-deleted.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23286]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/db-comments-deleted.jpg?resize=644%2C604" alt="db-comments-deleted" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23312" /></a></p>\n<p>Cohen concludes the article by apologizing and petitioning his customers to have some understanding for their growing pains:</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;To anyone that has had a support issue in the past, or is having one now, I would like to say I’m sorry for your experience. But as you can see, we&#8217;ve been busy.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>WP Engine seems to have gone into damage control mode, as Woodward&#8217;s critical review has been shared liberally on social networks, causing many early fans of the host to voice similar concerns. Woodward suspects the company&#8217;s recent funding as a potential cause for the decline in the quality of support:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Now instead of dealing with actual WordPress experts, you’re dealing with customer service staff that have had minor WordPress training and fail to understand the basics&#8230;Then you have to consider the $15 million investment by venture capitalist firm North Bridge which pushes the focus towards money and profits rather than passion and innovation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Is the company growing too fast to maintain its former sterling reputation? The statement and apology issued today isn&#8217;t likely to have been motivated by a single bad review. WP Engine is currently fighting an uphill battle in order to regain the consumer confidence it commanded in the early days, while the managed WordPress hosting space is getting more competitive. Customer reviews make it clear that a company&#8217;s dedication to innovation means nothing if it cannot deliver the support to back it up.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 21 May 2014 22:06:40

If you want to get back at the FCC, consider using the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/fcc-slow-lane/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/fcc-slow-lane/">FCC Slow Lane</a> plugin. The plugin allows users to protest the FCC by slowing down their websites to a crawl when an IP address registered to the FCC is detected.

It also displays a header on top of your site for five seconds stating that they have been slowed down due to the FCC position regarding net neutrality. By slowing down your website to IP addresses registered to the FCC, they get to see first-hand what the Internet is like in the slow lane. The IP address ranges are publicly known and are in CIDR format.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>192.133.125.0/24</li>\n<li>165.135.0.0/16</li>\n<li>192.104.54.0/24</li>\n<li>4.21.126.0/24</li>\n<li>65.125.25.64/26</li>\n<li>208.23.64.0/25</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although there are no options to configure, it would be nice if there was a way to increase the time it takes to load the page to give those IP addresses the extra slow treatment. When installed, you can see how the notification header will look by adding <strong>?fcc=demo-on</strong> at the end of the URL. Alternatively, you can use <strong>?fcc=show-fcc-ips</strong> to see which blocks of IP addresses are being targeted. It&#8217;s not pretty, but it gets the message across.</p>\n<div id="attachment_23233" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FCCSLowLaneHeader.png" rel="prettyphoto[23231]"><img class="size-full wp-image-23233" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FCCSLowLaneHeader.png?resize=1025%2C223" alt="When a visitor with an FCC IP address visits the site, they''ll see this header." /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When a visitor with an FCC IP address visits the site, they&#8217;ll see this header.</p></div>\n<p>If there is enough interest, <a title="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-request-throttle-the-fcc-to-dial-up-modem-speeds-on-your-website-nginx#post-5592702" href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-request-throttle-the-fcc-to-dial-up-modem-speeds-on-your-website-nginx#post-5592702">Evoknow said</a> he&#8217;ll create an administrative backend to add new blocks of IP addresses. This would help spread the word to other political officials. FCC Slow Lane works fine with WordPress 3.9.1 and is one of the easiest ways to protest the FCC.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Sites Used As Protesting Machines</h3>\n<p>FCC slow lane is another example of turning WordPress sites into protesting machines. In 2012, users were able to protest SOPA via the <a title="http://wptavern.com/go-black-with-the-sopa-blackout-plugin" href="http://wptavern.com/go-black-with-the-sopa-blackout-plugin">SOPA Blackout plugin</a>. <a title="http://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-aims-to-fight-back-against-mass-surveillance" href="http://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-aims-to-fight-back-against-mass-surveillance">Earlier this year</a>, thousands participated in the The Day We Fight Back campaign <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/tdwfb/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/tdwfb/">via a plugin</a>.  With WordPress powering more than 22% of the web, it&#8217;s becoming easier for digital citizens to fight back. As each site participates in a protest, the volume is raised. When WordPress.com and others <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-joins-google-reddit-and-tumblr-in-protesting-nsa-surveillance" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-joins-google-reddit-and-tumblr-in-protesting-nsa-surveillance">joined together</a> to protest against NSA surveillance, <a title="https://thedaywefightback.org/the-results/" href="https://thedaywefightback.org/the-results/">the volume was deafening</a>.</p>\n<p>What would happen if only 5-10% of WordPress powered sites protested against specific causes? Would it be enough to affect change? Is it possible to change the future by using WordPress sites to protest or is it just a bunch of noise at the end of the day?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 21 May 2014 01:40:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"WPTavern: WordCamp Central Proposes Centralizing Post WordCamp Surveys";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23204";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:184:"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-central-proposes-centralizing-post-wordcamp-surveys?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-central-proposes-centralizing-post-wordcamp-surveys";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3729:"<p>After attending a WordCamp, you&#8217;ll sometimes receive an email with a survey asking for your thoughts on how it went.

Organizers could then publicize the survey making it easy to find. After a period of two weeks, results would be exported to the organizing team. Further enhancements could include an automated system that would send the survey out to attendees a day after the event. A post announcing the survey could also be included within the automated routine.</p>\n<h3>Should Surveys From WordCamp Central Be Opt-in?</h3>\n<p>In the comments of the proposal, David Bisset, who helped organized WordCamp Miami, <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/05/16/one-survey-to-rule-them-all/#comment-8864" href="http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/05/16/one-survey-to-rule-them-all/#comment-8864">recommended that the surveys be opt-in</a>. Having a default set of questions is great for smaller venues but for larger camps, it can be more beneficial for organizers if they had the ability to ask specific questions.</p>\n<p>Middleton <a title="http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/05/16/one-survey-to-rule-them-all/#comment-8865" href="http://make.wordpress.org/community/2014/05/16/one-survey-to-rule-them-all/#comment-8865">suggested a solution</a> with a two pronged approach. Organizers could opt-in to the centralized survey but also allow them to create event specific questions. That way, WordCamp Central receives comparable <strong>and</strong> specific data from events trying new things.</p>\n<blockquote><p>On the individualized surveys, that’s definitely a thing. Opt-in to the centralized survey could work, or we could add branching to the centralized survey and let people add event-specific questions if they wanted to. That way we’d get the same comparable data but also be able to gather event-specific data. I’d actually quite like to do that for those events that are trying new things.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>The More Data Available To Organizers The Better</h3>\n<p>Most of the WordCamps I&#8217;ve attended within the past two years have not sent out surveys to gather feedback. For those that have, I&#8217;ve provided them all the information I would have shared in a blog post. In many instances, a blog post recapping the event is the only way for me to give feedback. If the survey results are accessible, other organizers can step in with a history of what has and has not been successful.</p>\n<p>I applaud Middleton for the proposal and would like to see more WordCamps offer ways for attendees to provide feedback. The more centralized, accessible data organizers have at their disposal to improve their events, the better.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 May 2014 22:36:26 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:109:"WPTavern: Jetpack 3.0 Released, Adds Bulk Module Management, Site Verification and Twitter Open Graph Support";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23167";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:258:"http://wptavern.com/jetpack-3-0-released-adds-bulk-module-management-site-verification-and-twitter-open-graph-support?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jetpack-3-0-released-adds-bulk-module-management-site-verification-and-twitter-open-graph-support";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4373:"<p>Jetpack 3.0 was released today with a couple of brand new features and an updated interface for managing modules and settings.

Previously you would have to navigate a couple clicks deep into each module to know if it&#8217;s on and to deactivate it.

It can be configured under the Tools menu and allows you to enter your meta key &#8220;content&#8221; value to verify your blog with Google Webmaster Tools, Bing Webmaster Center and Pinterest Site Verification.</p>\n<p>When you update to Jetpack 3.0, this module will be automatically turned on with the message: <strong>&#8220;The following new modules have been activated: Site Verification.&#8221;</strong> Automatic activation of new modules has been a controversial policy of the plugin in the past, but for now it comes part and parcel with using Jetpack.</p>\n<h3>New: Twitter Open Graph Support</h3>\n<p>Jetpack 3.0 adds support for Twitter to its Open Graph meta tags. This means that your site will now have support for <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards" target="_blank">Twitter Cards</a>. There is currently no admin interface for assigning your own Twitter account as the site owner (it defaults to Jetpack), but Justin Kopepasah posted a <a href="http://kopepasah.com/tutorial/change-jetpack-3-0s-default-twitter-card-site-tag/" target="_blank">quick tutorial</a> for filtering it to use your own account.</p>\n<h3>Major Enhancements in Jeptack 3.0</h3>\n<p>This release comes with a long list of enhancements to the plugin, along with a healthy does of bug fixes. Most of the enhancements are small improvements to the existing modules. If there&#8217;s some aspect of flexibility that you found missing from one of Jetpack&#8217;s modules, chances are you that you may find it on this list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>New look for the Sharing module</li>\n<li>Multiple improvements on which Twitter handle a Twitter card will display</li>\n<li>Add option to hide Google+ Authorship banner while still receiving the benefits</li>\n<li>Many Infinite Scroll enhancements to improve performance</li>\n<li>Infinite Scroll will use your CPT&#8217;s display name instead of &#8220;Older Posts&#8221;</li>\n<li>JSON API added /media/new endpoint</li>\n<li>Added filter to assign new default image for Open Graph tags</li>\n<li>New [ jetpack-related-posts ] shortcode to add Related Posts to page instead of default placement</li>\n<li>Added SSO option to turn off login form completely, to use WordPress.com login exclusively</li>\n<li>The  shortcode allows for Google Maps Engine</li>\n<li>YouTube shortcode allows HD playback</li>\n<li>Smoother, Faster Tiled Galleries!</li>\n<li>New languages! Use Jetpack in Irish, Fulah, and Tigrinya</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Jetpack 3.0 is a major update to the plugin and should greatly improve the experience of managing all of its features in the backend. This new settings screen comes at the right time, as Jetpack has accumulated more than 30 modules, each of which could technically constitute their own plugins.

The navigation is easy to use and the table of contents are always a mouse click away. The stories are easy to read thanks to the use of large images, pull quotes, and videos. I asked the developer of AESOP Story Engine, Nick Haskins, what he thought about the site:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think overall it&#8217;s a really great use of Aesop Story Engine. The more real-life projects that we see go up, the more insight it gives us into how people are actually using the plugin. You can design it one way, and people will use it in an entirely different way, so it&#8217;s really interesting (and important) for us to see how different outfits are leveraging the plugin</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is one of the first examples I&#8217;ve seen that shows what AESOP is capable of. Have you seen other examples of AESOP in action? If so, share them in the comments.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 May 2014

Unless you have a solid plugin in place, open registration comes with the wearisome task of wading through new signups to put the axe to spammers who got through.</p>\n<p>One of the common ways of combatting registration spam is to lay a snare at the doorstep of your site by creating a hidden field. Human registrants cannot see the field and therefore leave it blank. Spambots, however, will automatically fill out the field and get caught chasing the &#8220;honeypot.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/registration-honeypot/" target="_blank">Registration Honeypot</a> is a new free plugin that combats spambots using the tried and true honeypot method. There&#8217;s nothing to configure and no settings panel &#8211; simply activate it and leave it. Spammers caught in the act will see the following message:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/spammer-message.png" rel="prettyphoto[22653]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/spammer-message.png?resize=789%2C148" alt="spammer-message" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23146" /></a></p>\n<p>While Registration Honeypot isn&#8217;t built around an original concept, it&#8217;s the simplified implementation that counts here. Justin Tadlock, founder of <a href="http://themehybrid.com" target="_blank">Theme Hybrid</a>, created the plugin because he couldn&#8217;t find a simple honeypot plugin that wasn&#8217;t loaded down with extra, unnecessary settings.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s an overly simple method for catching one type of spam,&#8221; Tadlock said in his plugin announcement <a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/registration-honeypot-wordpress-plugin" target="_blank">post</a>. <strong>&#8220;But it’s useful and handles a good 99% of all spam registration issues I’ve seen.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re on the hunt for a new plugin to combat registration spam and you want a quality plug-n-play solution, give <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/registration-honeypot/" target="_blank">Registration Honeypot</a> a try. Like all other Theme Hybrid plugins, it&#8217;s available for free on WordPress.org. It&#8217;s not going to stop 100% of spam registrations but it will shut down the bots who cannot resist the honey.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 May 2014 07:05:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"WordPress.tv: Julie Kosbab: Site Analytics In WordPress: Building For Success";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wordpress.tv/?p=34787";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"http://wordpress.tv/2014/05/19/uploaded-video-19/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:643:"<div id="v-VRsuatiS-1" class="video-player">\n</div><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/34787/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/34787/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=34787&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" /><div><a href="http://wordpress.tv/2014/05/19/uploaded-video-19/"><img alt="Julie Kosbab:  Site Analytics in WordPress" src="http://videos.videopress.com/VRsuatiS/video-79a49ca021_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg" width="160" height="120" /></a></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 20 May 2014 04:13:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:12:"WordPress.tv";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: WordPress for Android Will No Longer Support Gingerbread";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23104";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:176:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-android-will-no-longer-support-gingerbread?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-for-android-will-no-longer-support-gingerbread";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3960:"<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/googleplex-treats.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23104]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/googleplex-treats.jpg?resize=975%2C440" alt="googleplex-treats" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23114" /></a></p>\n<p>Long time Android users will remember how much of leap forward Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 (ICS) was for the platform in 2011. As the vastly improved successor to Android 2.3 Gingerbread, it was one of the largest upgrades to Android OS in history, creating a demarcation line between the much older versions and the newer ones that would follow. (Android OS versions are released in alphabetical order under sugary treat code names.)</p>\n<p>ICS came with a completely redesigned UI and the new Roboto typeface. It introduced a new voice input engine and a ton of new media capabilities. The 4.0 version added more intuitive gestures and allowed app developers to make use of them, too. Android developers often refer to the ICS release as a pivotal point in the platform&#8217;s development, given how much changed.</p>\n<h3>WordPress for Android Mobile App to Drop Gingerbread Support</h3>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/chomp.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23104]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/chomp.jpg?resize=296%2C300" alt="chomp" class="alignright size-full wp-image-23115" /></a>The WordPress for Android development team <a href="http://android.wordpress.org/2014/05/16/wordpress-for-android-no-longer-paying-the-gingerbread-tax/" target="_blank">announced</a> today that it will no longer support Gingerbread.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that ICS was released in 2011, many people are still using devices that don&#8217;t support anything past Gingerbread. In an effort to reach the largest number of users, the WordPress app has maintained compatibility with older versions, incurring a ton of extra development time.</p>\n<p>Recent numbers showing the <a href="http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html" target="_blank">relative number of devices on various Android platform versions</a> puts Gingerbread at about 16% this month, down 1% from April:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/android-version-usage.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23104]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/android-version-usage.jpg?resize=802%2C366" alt="android-version-usage" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23119" /></a></p>\n<p>The cost of supporting Gingerbread for a small portion of the WordPress app&#8217;s user base (which is actually less than 10%) causes the everyone else to suffer what they are calling the “Gingerbread tax” while waiting for new features:</p>\n<blockquote><p>This means over 90% of our users are paying a “Gingerbread tax” – waiting longer for new versions and not seeing features that take advantage of their phones – so that we can continue supporting older devices.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The upcoming version 2.9 of WordPress for Android will only support devices running Android 4.0 or later, allowing its developers to be more productive. The app itself will also become faster and smaller for the majority of people who are using it.</p>\n<p>Please note that it doesn&#8217;t mean that the app is disappearing for these devices. An older version will still be available from the Google Play store for use with older phones and tablets that are still running on Gingerbread.</p>\n<p>Gingerbread support will officially be dropped later this month when WordPress for Android 2.9 is expected to be released. This version will also include a new Blog Discovery feature for finding blogs based on recommendation as well the ability to preview a blog&#8217;s posts before electing to follow. Subscription management will also be included, along with a number of helpful UI improvements.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 19 May 2014 23:12:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: WordCamp Miami Kids’ Workshop Launches the Next Generation of Bloggers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=23037";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:202:"http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-kids-workshop-launches-the-next-generation-of-bloggers?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-miami-kids-workshop-launches-the-next-generation-of-bloggers";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6407:"<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/recap-of-wordcamp-miami-2014" target="_blank">WordCamp Miami</a> celebrated its 5th anniversary this year, drawing 770+ people to the event. The organizers also hosted their first <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-miami-to-host-free-wordpress-beginners-workshop-for-kids" target="_blank">WordPress beginner&#8217;s workshop for kids</a> as part of the Sunday activities.</p>\n<p>Tammie Lister, Kathryn Presner and I worked together to lead the workshop, along with volunteers Noel Tock, Mika Epstein, and Suzette Franck. The session was geared toward kids aged 8-12 and each child attended with a parent. We had two hours to give an introduction to WordPress and help the kids set up their own blogs. At the end of the morning, each child had published a post to the internet.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Personally, this is most likely the proudest photo from <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wcmia&src=hash">#wcmia</a> : Our 1st Kid’s Workshop. <a href="http://t.co/KecwSCwVM5">pic.twitter.com/KecwSCwVM5</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/statuses/466574992105164800">May 14, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lister designed the slides for the presentation with a Minecraft theme, which ended up being a big win, since the vast majority of the kids present were wild about the game. She used aspects of Minecraft to help us explain the concept of open source, WordPress blogging tools, themes, commenting, subscribing and making friends online.</p>\n<p>We guided the kids through signing up on WordPress.com to create a free blog. A couple of them already had blogs on a network hosted by their parents, but most of them were experiencing WordPress for the first time, including many of their parents. I came away from the workshop with three observations regarding kids and WordPress.</p>\n<h3>1. WordPress is Easy for Kids to Use</h3>\n<p>The most time-consuming aspect of the workshop was getting kids signed up to WordPress.com and making sure everyone recieved the confirmation email. Not all of the kids had their own email addresses but those who didn&#8217;t were able to use a parent&#8217;s address. Once inside the WordPress admin, the kids took to blogging quite naturally and didn&#8217;t require much hand-holding.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kidsblogging.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[23037]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/kidsblogging.jpg?resize=1025%2C769" alt="kidsblogging" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23048" /></a></p>\n<p>After publishing their first posts, the kids linked up to comment on each other&#8217;s blogs and discovered the comment notifications and relevant admin screens on their own. Adding images/media was no sweat for them and many were eager to publish additional posts after the first one.</p>\n<h3>2. The Joy of Publishing is Timeless</h3>\n<p>One might think that the concept of blogs would be old news to kids who who have never known a world without the internet. While media and technology <del datetime="2014-05-19T15:44:00+00:00">curmudgeons</del> analysts, who count themselves on the cutting edge, like to proclaim that <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113053/new-york-times-buzzfeed-andrew-sullivan-herald-death-blog" target="_blank">blogs are dead</a>, these kids are discovering publishing for the first time.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/jahdin.png" rel="prettyphoto[23037]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/jahdin.png?resize=1025%2C517" alt="jahdin" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-23073" /></a></p>\n<p>Upon hitting the &#8220;Publish&#8221; button, workshop attendee Jahdin, pictured above, put his hands in the air and shouted, <strong>&#8220;I just published my first post to the Internet!&#8221;</strong> His blog was about his ninth birthday party and included a picture from the event. I asked him what he plans to write about in the future, and he said, <strong>&#8220;I plan to blog about how life was when I was a kid.&#8221;</strong></p>\n<p>If you can remember back to the thrill of publishing your thoughts to the web for the first time, that&#8217;s exactly what we saw in the kids&#8217; reactions to putting their first posts out there. WordPress gives them a place to record their thoughts and experiences in a way that can be shared with friends and relatives who want to follow their adventures.</p>\n<p>Jahdin&#8217;s plan to &#8220;blog about life when I was a kid&#8221; is one of the most common reasons many of us started blogging in the first place &#8211; to record our own history. This is the next generation of people building the web. Putting the power of publishing in their hands and introducing them to new ideas, such as open source software, gives each child a simple framework for understanding themselves as a person with a voice on the web.</p>\n<h3>3. Kids Might Enjoy More Advanced Workshops</h3>\n<p>The first kids workshop at WordCamp Miami was a great success and it seems that even more advanced kids workshops would go over well, based on the response. Learning the basics of themes, plugins and WordPress core would be interesting things to explore with them, as some of the older kids seemed eager to know more about the building blocks of WordPress.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Miami isn&#8217;t the only event to host a workshop for kids. Both <a href="http://2014.phoenix.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Phoenix</a> and <a href="http://2013.albuquerque.wordcamp.org/session/wordpress-for-kids/" target="_blank">WordCamp Albuquerque</a> have held similar events. The workshop in Albuquerque is so popular that they&#8217;ve brought it back every year for the past three years.</p>\n<p>While WordCamps have always been open to people of all ages, having a dedicated session tailored for kids is an investment in the future publishers and makers of the web. Watching kids get excited about WordPress was one of the highlights of the event for me. If you have an active meetup group or are part of organizing a WordCamp, you might consider adding a session or even a track for kids. Helping them publish their first posts is an inspirational way to experience WordPress for the first time all over again.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 19 May 2014 19:24:37

The individuals within the team each have extensive experience in various sectors and it is the combination of these individuals and our strong partnership culture that, we believe, is key to Acorn’s success.\r\n\r\nAcorn provides a platform for wealthy individuals, institutions and funding partners to participate directly in private equity through the various Acorn funds and the investment company. We focus on the Sub-Sahara African SME sector in growing industries with companies that have scope for significant and sustainable growth.\r\n\r\nAs stewards of our investors’ capital we do not take on undue risk and will aim to make investments that have a relatively low risk in relation to the industry. We follow a rigorous and disciplined investment process based on sound fundamental analysis and thorough due diligence reviews.

(40, 1, '2014-04-10 07:27:22', '2014-04-10 07:27:22', 'Acorn provides several defining and differentiating qualities to our investors and our targeted investee companies:\r\n\r\n<strong>Alignment of interest</strong>\r\nAcorn is and will be a significant investor into each of its funds and will therefore have the same interests at heart as our fellow investors. The Partnership agreement has been structured to provide the investors (limited partners) with maximum protection. As General Partner, Acorn General Manager (Pty) Ltd does not have the benefit of limited liability.\r\n\r\n<strong>Investment size</strong>\r\nAcorn has identified the opportunity to invest in very promising Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that fall outside the mandates of the larger institutional private equity investors. This relatively untapped market has arisen due to the targeted deal sizes of most private equity houses in South Africa that are currently focusing on larger transactions (in excess of R100m). Acorn will focus on deals below R100 million and, as a result, have limited competitors and be more likely to negotiate favourable prices with target companies. This also bodes well for deal flow. Acorn will, however, also look at larger deals if the opportunity is attractive. In such cases, alternative options such as co-investment or investment through an SPV shall be considered.\r\n\r\n<strong>Deal flow</strong>\r\nAcorn has endeavoured to align itself with several key players in the targeted investment markets to ensure on-going deal flow and maintain a competitive advantage. These strategic alliances further provide invaluable insight into a wide spectrum of promising industries.\r\n\r\n<strong>Investment track record</strong>\r\nThe Acorn managers have proven track records of delivery and performance in the industry. It is worth mentioning that the principal of Acorn has shown historic annualised returns in excess of 62% for the 7 years ending February 2009 whilst at PSG. Although Acorn will not attempt to match these exceptional returns, it is an indication of the ability of the key individuals to achieve superior returns over a long-term period.\r\n\r\n<strong>Positioning and timing</strong>\r\n<em>“History shows that the best private equity funds are born after the ends of recessions.” David Snow. </em>\r\n\r\nAcorn has positioned itself to take advantage of the current pricing in the markets and is able to enter into transactions on very favourable terms. The current economic situation has created opportunities to build a very profitable portfolio at substantially discounted prices. Acorn will also apply appropriate exit strategies to take advantage of the market cycles and maximise partners’ returns once the markets and economies have stabilised.\r\n\r\n<strong>Market knowledge</strong>\r\nThe key individuals of Acorn Equity have in-depth private equity experience and a strong understanding of Southern African markets.\r\n\r\n<strong>Superior governance</strong>\r\nAcorn has chosen to be a FSB registered investment manager. This is not a requirement for Acorn, but serves as a strong governance process to provide comfort and security to all investors. Acorn is absolutely committed to doing business in an ethical way, and will act honestly and ethically in all of its dealings and negotiations with business partners. In addition, Acorn has also opted to outsource its compliance function to Moonstone Compliance (Pty) Ltd - an independent provider.\r\n\r\n<strong>Selective deal making</strong>\r\nAcorn will be very selective in the transactions that it enters into. Acorn’s strong deal flow potential will allow us the luxury of being selective about the investments we make. Up to two seats on our investment committee will be made available to Partners invited at the discretion of Acorn. This will allow those partners to contribute and partake in the management and decision making processes at a strategic level. Acorn will also appoint independent non-executive members to the investment committee.\r\n\r\n<strong>Strict risk management</strong>\r\nAcorn will endeavour to achieve returns superior to the industry standard without assuming additional or unnecessary risk through its investments. Acorn will not enter into potential high-return transactions if the risk is deemed to outweigh the potential returns of the transaction. All partners need to accept that a higher degree of risk is inherent in the industry, but that Acorn will strictly manage and limit that risk, within reason.\r\n\r\n<strong>Creative approach to acquisitions and operational expertise</strong>\r\nThe Acorn team has proven its ability and experience in being creative and innovative when it comes to the structuring of acquisitions, the disposals of investments and the closing of transactions.', 'Why Acorn', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'why-acorn', '', '', '2014-05-06 13:59:29', '2014-05-06 11:59:29', '', 5, 'http://localhost/~tyronestafford/acorn/?page_id=40', 0, 'page', '', 0),

Through Carl´s dealings with Whitehall and Goldman Sachs, he was subsequently recruited to the head-offices of the Westmont Group in London.

Following this he spent almost six years in London working at Investec Bank and Investec Asset Management.

(199, 1, '2014-04-24 11:23:44', '2014-04-24 09:23:44', 'Acorn provides several defining and differentiating qualities to our investors and our targeted investee companies:\r\n\r\n<strong>Alignment of interest</strong>\r\nAcorn is and will be a significant investor into each of its funds and will therefore have the same interests at heart as our fellow investors. The Partnership agreement has been structured to provide the investors (limited partners) with maximum protection. As General Partner, Acorn General Manager (Pty) Ltd does not have the benefit of limited liability.\r\n\r\n<strong>Investment size</strong>\r\nAcorn has identified the opportunity to invest in very promising Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) that fall outside the mandates of the larger institutional private equity investors. This relatively untapped market has arisen due to the targeted deal sizes of most private equity houses in South Africa that are currently focusing on larger transactions (in excess of R100m). Acorn will focus on deals below R100 million and, as a result, have limited competitors and be more likely to negotiate favourable prices with target companies. This also bodes well for deal flow. Acorn will, however, also look at larger deals if the opportunity is attractive. In such cases, alternative options such as co-investment or investment through an SPV shall be considered.\r\n\r\n<strong>Deal flow</strong>\r\nAcorn has endeavoured to align itself with several key players in the targeted investment markets to ensure on-going deal flow and maintain a competitive advantage. These strategic alliances further provide invaluable insight into a wide spectrum of promising industries.\r\n\r\n<strong>Investment track record</strong>\r\nThe Acorn managers have proven track records of delivery and performance in the industry. It is worth mentioning that the principal of Acorn has shown historic annualised returns in excess of 62% for the 7 years ending February 2009 whilst at PSG. Although Acorn will not attempt to match these exceptional returns, it is an indication of the ability of the key individuals to achieve superior returns over a long-term period.\r\n\r\n<strong>Positioning and timing</strong>\r\n<em>“History shows that the best private equity funds are born after the ends of recessions.” David Snow. </em>\r\n\r\nAcorn has positioned itself to take advantage of the current pricing in the markets and is able to enter into transactions on very favourable terms. The current economic situation has created opportunities to build a very profitable portfolio at substantially discounted prices. Acorn will also apply appropriate exit strategies to take advantage of the market cycles and maximise partners’ returns once the markets and economies have stabilised.\r\n\r\n<strong>Market knowledge</strong>\r\nThe key individuals of Acorn Equity have in-depth private equity experience and a strong understanding of Southern African markets.\r\n\r\n<strong>Superior governance</strong>\r\nAcorn has chosen to be a FSB registered investment manager.
